### Introduction: 
We have been witnessing the wrath of the COVID-19 Pandemic for a year now. While this fatal airborne disease continues to spread around the globe, it has put health care facilities under immense pressure.  In most of the regions, hospitals are outnumbered by the increase in number of patients. Patients with normal cough, cold  or some trivial infection are not being attended without a negative report, even though the patient doesn’t show all symptoms of COVID-19. Through this platform, we aim to minimize the communication gap between the patient and the health care service providers by developing an online interface that can improve accessibility, quality of  treatment, avoid physical contact with any other person and reduce the long waiting hours. Medipoint is a mobile application which optimizes medical healthcare services and improvises patients' health care journey. It caters to the health care needs of the people by providing “At-Home Service”.
