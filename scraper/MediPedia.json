[{"Name": "Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm", "Information": "\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta \u2013 the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body.\nThe abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide \u2013 roughly the width of a garden hose. However, it can swell to over 5.5cm \u2013 what doctors class as a large AAA.\nLarge aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. If a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal.\nThe bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. Although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm.\nAAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group.\nThis is why all men are invited for a\u00a0screening test when they turn 65. The test involves a simple ultrasound scan, which takes around 10-15 minutes.\nSymptoms of an AAA\nIn most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their\u00a0abdomen (tummy)\u00a0or persistent back pain.\nAn AAA doesn\u2019t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there\u2019s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture).\nA ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery.\nThe most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen.\nIf you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\nRead more about the symptoms of an AAA.\nCauses of an AAA\nIt's not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.\nThere are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level.\nHaving a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself.\nRead more about the causes of an AAA.\nDiagnosing an AAA\nBecause AAAs usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination \u2013 for example, if a GP notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen.\nThe screening test is an\u00a0ultrasound scan,\u00a0which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. This is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one.\nRead more about diagnosing an AAA.\nTreating an AAA\nIf a large AAA is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent\u00a0it rupturing.\nThis is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing.\nIf surgery is not advisable \u2013 or if you decide not to have it \u2013 there are a number of non-surgical treatments that can reduce the risk of an aneurysm rupturing.\nThey include medications to lower\u00a0your cholesterol and blood pressure, and quitting smoking.\nYou will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning.\nRead more about treating AAAs.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent getting an aneurysm \u2013 or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing \u2013 is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as:\n\nsmoking\neating a high-fat diet\nnot exercising regularly\nbeing overweight or obese\n\nRead more about preventing aneurysms.\nScreening\nRead more about screening for an AAA.\n"}, {"Name": "Acne", "Information": "\nAcne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point.

It is a potentially serious condition that usually needs to be treated in hospital.\nThe\u00a0main symptom\u00a0of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy (abdomen) that spreads towards your right shoulder.\nThe affected part of the abdomen is usually extremely tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse.\nUnlike some others types of abdominal pain, the pain associated with acute cholecystitis is usually persistent, and doesn't go away within a few hours.\nSome people may additional symptoms, such as:\n\na high temperature (fever)\nnausea and vomiting\nsweating\nloss of appetite\nyellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)\na bulge in the abdomen\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see your GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if the pain lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a fever.\nIf it's not possible to contact your GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call the NHS 24 111 service for advice.\nIt's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because there is a risk that serious complications could develop if the condition is not treated promptly\u00a0(see below).\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat causes acute cholecystitis?\nThe causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2\u00a0main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.\nCalculous cholecystitis\nCalculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.\nCalculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or by a substance known as biliary sludge.\nBiliary sludge is a mixture of bile (a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats) and small crystals of cholesterol and salt.\nThe blockage in the cystic duct results in a build-up of bile in the gallbladder, increasing the\u00a0pressure inside it and causing it to\u00a0become inflamed. In around 1\u00a0in every 5\u00a0cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria.\nAcalculous cholecystitis\nAcalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It\u00a0usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.\nAcalculous cholecystitis is often associated with problems such as accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns, blood poisoning (sepsis), severe malnutrition\u00a0or AIDS.\nWho is affected\nAcute cholecystitis is a relatively common complication of gallstones.\nIt is estimated that around 10-15% of adults in the UK have gallstones. These\u00a0don't usually cause any symptoms, but in a small proportion of people they can cause\u00a0infrequent episodes of pain (known as biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis.\nDiagnosing cholecystitis\nTo diagnose acute cholecystitis, your GP will examine your abdomen.\nThey will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy\u2019s sign. You will\u00a0be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage.\nYour gallbladder will move downwards as your breathe in and, if you have cholecystitis, you will experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor\u2019s hand.\nIf your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP\u00a0will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment.\nTests you may have in hospital include:\n\nblood tests\u00a0to check for signs of inflammation in your body\nan\u00a0ultrasound scan of your abdomen to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder\n\nOther scans \u2013 such as an X-ray, a\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan or a\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 may also be carried out to examine your gallbladder in more detail if there is any uncertainty about your diagnosis.\nTreating acute cholecystitis\nIf you are diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you will probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.\nInitial treatment\nInitial treatment will usually involve:\n\nfasting (not eating or drinking) to take the strain off your gallbladder\nreceiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration\ntaking medication to relieve your pain\n\nIf you have a suspected infection, you will also be given antibiotics. These\u00a0often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital or you may be able to go home.\nWith this initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused the\u00a0condition\u00a0usually fall back into the gallbladder and the inflammation\u00a0often settles down.\nSurgery\nIn order to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring, and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications, the removal of your gallbladder will often be recommended at some point\u00a0after the initial treatment.\u00a0This type of surgery\u00a0is known as a cholecystectomy.\nAlthough uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you are too unwell to have surgery. This is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that has built up in the gallbladder.\nIf you are fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will\u00a0need to decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder may be. In some cases, you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or 2, while in other cases you may be advised to\u00a0wait for the inflammation to fully resolve over the next few weeks.\nSurgery can be carried out in two main ways:\n\nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy\u00a0\u2013 a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen\nopen cholecystectomy\u00a0\u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single, larger incision in your abdomen\n\nAlthough some people who have had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, you\u00a0can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder.\nThe organ can be useful but it's not essential, as your liver will still produce bile to digest food.\nPossible complications\nWithout appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications.\nThe main complications of acute cholecystitis are:\n\nthe death of the tissue of the gallbladder, called gangrenous cholecystitis, which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body\nthe gallbladder splitting open, known as a perforated gallbladder, which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess)\n\nIn about 1\u00a0in every 5\u00a0cases of acute cholecystitis, emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications.\nPreventing acute cholecystitis\nIt's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by cutting your risk of gallstones.\nOne of the main steps you can take to help lower your chances of developing gallstones is\u00a0adopting a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet and reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones.\nBeing overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.\nHowever, low-calorie, rapid weight loss diets should be avoided, because there is evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best.\u00a0\nRead more about preventing gallstones.\n"}, {"Name": "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia", "Information": "\nLeukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means the condition progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.\nAcute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. There are two main types:\n\nlymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections\nneutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\u00a0\n\nThese pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:\n\nchronic lymphocytic leukaemia\nchronic myeloid leukaemia\nacute myeloid leukaemia\n\nWarning signs of acute leukaemia\nSymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\u00a0usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases (see below for an explanation of this). Symptoms\u00a0include:\n\npale skin\ntiredness\nbreathlessness\nhaving repeated infections over a short space of time\nunusual and frequent bleeding\n\nRead more about the symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nWhat happens in acute leukaemia\nAll of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow \u2013 a spongy material found inside bones.\nBone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells:\n\nred blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body\nwhite blood cells, which help fight infection\nplatelets, which help stop bleeding\n\nThe bone marrow usually produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. But in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells.\nAs the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. This drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding.\nAlso, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nAround 8,600 people are diagnosed with leukaemia each year in the UK. In 2011, 654 people were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\nDespite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children. Approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it. About 85% of cases occur in children aged under 15, mostly between the ages of two and five years old.\nThe cause or causes of acute leukaemia are uncertain, but known risk factors include:\n\nexposure to high levels of radiation\nexposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettes\n\nRead more information about the causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nOutlook\nThe outlook for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is usually good. Almost all children will achieve remission (a period of time where they are free from symptoms) from their symptoms, and 85% will be completely cured.\nThe outlook for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less promising as only 40% of people with the condition will be completely cured.\nTreatments for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually involve a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant may also be needed to achieve a cure.\nRead more about the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nIf a cure is not possible, there is a risk that the lack of healthy blood cells can make the person extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections (due to the lack of white blood cells) or uncontrolled and serious bleeding (due to the lack of platelets).\n"}, {"Name": "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Children", "Information": "\nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. One-third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia, with approximately 400 new cases in the UK each year. Approximately, three out of four of these cases are acute lymphoblastic (ALL). ALL can affect children of any age but is more common in children aged 1-4 years old.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nLeukaemia\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some bones in the body.\nBone marrow contains:\n\nred blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body\nplatelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding\nwhite blood cells, which help fight infection\n\nThere are two different types of white blood cells; lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). These white blood cells work together to fight infection. Normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. In leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature.\nThese immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. As the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. This leads to an increased risk of infection.\nThere are four main types of leukaemia:\n\nacute lymphoblastic (ALL)\nacute myeloid (AML)\u00a0\nchronic lymphocyte (CLL)\nchronic myeloid (CML)\n\nChronic leukaemias usually affect adults and each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment. ALL is a cancer of immature lymphocytes, called lymphoblasts or blast cells.\nThere are two different types of lymphocytes; T-cells and B-cells. Often, leukaemia occurs at a very early stage in the immature lymphocytes, before they have developed into either T-cells or B-cells. However, if the cells have developed this far before becoming leukaemic, the type of leukaemia may be known as T-cell or B-cell leukaemia.\nThis\u00a0is about acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).\nCauses\nThe exact cause of ALL is unknown. Research is going on all the time into possible causes of this disease. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as Down\u2019s syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with ALL (particularly identical twins) have a slightly increased risk of developing ALL themselves, although\u00a0this risk is still small.\nLike all cancers, ALL is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.\nSigns and symptoms\nAs the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.\nChildren may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood (which help blood to clot). Sometimes, children suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.\nA child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.\nAt first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.\nHow ALL is diagnosed\nA blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of the abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. A sample is also sent to the genetics department to look for any abnormal chromosomes, and for a test called MRD (minimal residual disease) analysis.\nA test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. A chest x-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. Other tests may be necessary, depending on your child\u2019s symptoms.\nThese tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia and help doctors decide on the best treatment.\nTreatment\nThe aim of treatment for ALL is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ALL and is given according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).\nThe treatment is given in several phases, or \u2018blocks\u2019, which are explained below.\nInduction\nThis phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible and is usually started within days of being diagnosed. The induction phase lasts 4-6 weeks. A bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. The sample that is taken is looked at under a microscope and when there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child\u2019s condition is referred to as being in \u2018remission\u2019.\nConsolidation and central nervous system (CNS) treatment\nThe next phase of treatment is aimed at maintaining the remission and preventing the spread of leukaemia cells into the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system, or CNS). CNS treatment involves injecting a drug, usually methotrexate lumbar puncture.\nAfter this consolidation treatment there is a recovery period which is called interim maintenance. This is when more drugs will be given to try to keep the leukaemia in remission. The exact details will depend on which arm of treatment your child follows and will be discussed in detail by your child\u2019s doctor as it depends on your child\u2019s response to treatment so far.\nFurther doses of chemotherapy treatment, called \u2018delayed intensification\u2019, are given to kill off any remaining leukaemia cells.\nMaintenance treatment\nThis phase of treatment lasts for two years from the start of interim maintenance for girls and three years from the start of interim maintenance for boys. It involves the child taking daily and weekly tablets, some children also have monthly injections of chemotherapy and oral pulses of steroids and three-monthly intrathecal treatment.\nChildren will be able to take part in their normal daily activities as soon as they feel able to. Most children return to school before beginning maintenance treatment.\nBone marrow transplantation\nBone marrow treatment is only needed by a minority of patients and is used for children with ALL that is likely to come back following standard chemotherapy.\nTesticular radiotherapy\nIn some situations, it may be necessary for boys to have radiotherapy to their testicles. This is because leukaemia cells can survive in the testicles despite chemotherapy.\nCentral nervous system (CNS) radiotherapy\nChildren who have leukaemia cells in their CNS when they are first diagnosed with ALL need more frequent lumbar punctures with intrathecal chemotherapy. Your child\u2019s specialist will discuss with you which treatment and how much of it your child needs, and will answer any questions you have.\nSide effects of treatment\nMany cancer treatments will cause side effects. This is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells.\nSome of the main side effects of chemotherapy are:\n\nhair loss\nreduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection\nloss of appetite\nfeeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n\nSteroid medicines can also cause side effects such as:\n\nincreased appetite\nmood changes and irritability\nweight gain\nmuscle weakness (especially in the legs)\n\nMost side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible side effects. It is important to discuss any side effects your child is having with the team treating them, so that they know how your child is feeling.\nLate side effects of treatment\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way their heart works and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer later in life. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for ALL.\nIf appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given enough time to decide if it is right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the condition is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the UK. The\u00a0Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nMost children with ALL are cured. If the leukaemia recurs after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first three years. Further treatment can then be given.\nLong-term side effects (late side effects) are rare, and most children with ALL grow and develop normally.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Teenagers And Young Adults", "Information": "\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).

In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.\u00a0Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn\u2019t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.

Symptoms can include:\n\nlooking paler than usual and feeling tired - because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)\nbruises - you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal\ninfections - because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection\naches and pains in your bones\nswollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin\nfeeling unwell and run down\nfever and sweats - you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection\nheadaches and visual disturbance\n\nThere can be other reasons you may have these symptoms. But if you are worried that you may have ALL, you should see your family doctor (GP). They will examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.\nCauses\nWe don't know exactly what causes ALL, but research is going on to try to find out.\nYoung people with some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are at an increased risk of developing ALL. A genetic condition is something you are born with.\nIf you're worried about ALL\u00a0\nIf you think you have some of the symptoms of ALL you should go to your GP.

Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause,\u00a0these symptoms should be investigated.\nIf your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange blood tests to check your blood cell production. If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing AML\nWhat causes AML?\nAML\u00a0occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones),\u00a0produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells.\nBlast cells don't have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can\u00a0lead to a\u00a0decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot).\nIt's not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause. However,\u00a0a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include:\n\nprevious\u00a0chemotherapy or radiotherapy\nexposure to very high levels of radiation\u00a0(including previous\u00a0 radiotherapy\u00a0treatment)\nexposure to benzene \u2013 a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke\nhaving an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as Down's syndrome\n\nRead more about the causes of AML\nWho's affected\nAML\u00a0is a rare type of cancer, with around 2,600 people diagnosed with it\u00a0each year in the UK.\nThe risk of developing AML increases with\u00a0age. It's\u00a0most common in people over 65.\nHow AML is treated\nAML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed.\nChemotherapy\u00a0is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing).\nIn some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a\u00a0bone marrow or stem cell transplant, to achieve a cure.\nRead more about treating AML\nOutlook\nThe outlook for AML largely depends on the specific\u00a0type of AML you have,\u00a0as well as your\u00a0age and general health.\nThere are many subtypes of AML, which are classified according to various features \u2013 such as the specific genetic changes in the leukaemia cells. Some types of AML\u00a0are more challenging to treat than others.\nEven if treatment is initially successful, there's still a significant risk that the condition will return at some point during the next few years. If this happens, treatment may need to be repeated.\nA number of medical trials have suggested that almost half of those aged under 60 diagnosed with AML will live for at least five years, and in some types of AML, such as acute promyeloid leukaemia (APML), around 85% will live for at least five years.\nIn general, the outlook for children with AML tends to be better than that of adults diagnosed with the condition.\n"}, {"Name": "Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Children", "Information": "\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer. A third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia, with approximately 400 new cases occurring each year in the UK. Less than a quarter of these are acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). AML can affect children of any age; girls and boys are equally affected.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nLeukaemia\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some of the bones in the body.\nBone marrow contains:\n\nred blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body\nplatelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding\nwhite blood cells, which help to fight infection\n\nThere are two different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). These white blood cells work together to fight infection. Normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. In leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature.\nThese immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. As the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. This leads to an increased risk of infection.\nThere are four main types of leukaemia:\n\nacute lymphoblastic (ALL)\nacute myeloid (AML)\nchronic lymphocytic (CLL)\nchronic myeloid (CML)\n\nChronic leukaemias occur mostly in adults. CLL is exclusively an adult condition, whereas CML does occur rarely in children and young people. Each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment.\nThis is about acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML)\nAcute myeloid leukaemia is an overproduction of immature myeloid white blood cells (blast cells).\nCells that have started to show some of the features of myeloid cells are said to show differentiation. Cells that do not show signs of becoming a particular type of white blood cell are known as undifferentiated.\nThere are different sub-types of AML, depending upon exactly which type of cell has become leukaemic, the stage of development (maturation) the cells are at and whether the cells are differentiated. Knowing the sub-type of AML is important, as it helps doctors decide on the best treatment.\u00a0\nThere are several classification systems for the sub-types of AML. The most commonly used system in the UK is the French-American-British (FAB) system.\nFAB classification of AML\n\nM0 - AML with minimal evidence of myeloid differentiation\nM1 - AML without maturation\nM2 - AML with maturation\nM3 - Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)\nM4 - Acute myelomonocytic leukaemia\nM5 - Acute monocytic/monoblastic leukaemia\nM6 - Acute erythroleukaemia\nM7 - Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia\n\nA newer system known as the WHO (World Health Organization) classification system is also sometimes used.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of AML is unknown. Research into possible causes of this disease is ongoing. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as Down\u2019s syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with AML have a slightly increased risk of developing it, although this risk is still small. Other non-cancerous conditions, such as aplastic anaemia or the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), may increase a child\u2019s risk of developing AML.\nAML, like all types of cancer, is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.\nSigns and symptoms\nAs the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.\nChildren may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood. Sometimes they may suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.\nA child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.\nAt first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.\nHow AML is diagnosed\nA blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The bone marrow sample is also examined to check for any abnormalities in the chromosomes of the leukaemia cells.\nA test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. A chest x-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. Other tests may be necessary, depending on your child\u2019s symptoms.\nThese tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia, and help doctors to decide on the best treatment.\nTreatment\nThe aim of treatment for AML is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. Usually a combination of chemotherapy drugs is given, according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).\nThe treatment usually has different phases, explained below:\nInduction\nThis phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible. It usually involves two courses (cycles) of a combination of chemotherapy drugs.\nA bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. When there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child\u2019s condition is referred to as being in remission.\nPost-remission treatment\nWhen there are no signs of the leukaemia in the blood or bone marrow, further treatment is often given. This phase of the treatment aims to destroy any leukaemia cells that may be left and to help stop the AML from coming back. This treatment usually involves two more courses of chemotherapy.\nBone marrow transplant\nThis treatment is usually only used for children with AML that is likely to come back or has come back (recurred) following standard chemotherapy.\nCentral nervous system (CNS) treatment\nAML may sometimes develop in the brain and spinal cord. This can be prevented by injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the spinal fluid during a lumbar puncture (intrathecal chemotherapy). Intrathecal chemotherapy is usually given after each of the first two courses of chemotherapy. Sometimes a more intensive treatment is needed, and the intrathecal drugs are given more frequently until all the regular chemotherapy has been completed. Occasionally, radiotherapy to the brain is also necessary.\nSide effects of treatment\nMany cancer treatments will cause side effects. This is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells.\nSome of the main side effects are:\n\nhair loss\nreduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection)\nloss of appetite and weight\nfeeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n\nMost side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about side effects.\nLate side effects of treatment\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way the heart works, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer in later life. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for AML. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s cancer. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the cancer is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nMany children with AML are cured. If the leukaemia comes back after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first three years. Most children with AML grow and develop normally.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address\u00a0here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Teenagers And Young Adults", "Information": "\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\nFor information about AML in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0AML section.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.\nImmature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn\u2019t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to:\n\nhelp us fight infection (white cells)\ncarry oxygen from the lungs around our body (red blood cells)\nstop us bleeding when we cut ourselves by clotting our blood (platelets).\n\nSymptoms\nMany of the symptoms of AML are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:\n\nlooking paler than usual and feeling tired - because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)\nbruises or bleeding - you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal\ninfections - because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection\naches and pains in your bones\nswollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin\nfeeling unwell and run down\nfever and sweats - you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection\nheadaches and blurred vision - because of too many white blood cells\nbreathlessness\u00a0- because of too many white blood cells.\n\nCauses\nWe don't know exactly what causes AML, but research is going on to try to find out. We do know some things might increase the risk of AML:\n\nSome genetic conditions, like Down's Syndrome. A genetic condition is something you are born with.\nSome non-cancerous conditions of the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.\n\nIf you're worried about AML\nIf you think you might have any of the symptoms of AML, you should go to your GP. They'll talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and can arrange\u00a0tests or refer you to see a specialist.\u00a0Remember that the symptoms can be caused by other things, but it\u2019s important to go and get checked if you are worried.\u00a0\n"}, {"Name": "Acute Pancreatitis", "Information": "\nAcute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time.

They produce\u00a0essential hormones: cortisol,\u00a0aldosterone and adrenaline.\nIn Addison's disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced.\nAbout 8,400 people in the UK have Addison's disease. It can affect people of any age, although it's most common between the ages of 30 and 50.\u00a0It's also more common in women than\u00a0men.\nEarly-stage symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as\u00a0depression or flu.\u00a0You may experience:\n\nfatigue (lack of energy or motivation)\nmuscle weakness\nlow mood\nloss of appetite and unintentional weight loss\nincreased thirst\n\nOver time, these\u00a0problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting,\u00a0cramps\u00a0and exhaustion.

This is\u00a0called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD.\nFatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level.\nFatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for 2\u00a0weeks, your liver should return to normal.\nAlcoholic hepatitis\nAlcoholic\u00a0hepatitis\u00a0\u2013 which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol.\nLess commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking).\nThe liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently.\nSevere alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious\u00a0and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.\nCirrhosis\nCirrhosis\u00a0is a stage of\u00a0ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred.\u00a0Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms.\nIt's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy.\nA person who has\u00a0alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn't stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5\u00a0more years.\nHow ARLD is treated\nThere's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of\u00a0further damage to your liver and\u00a0gives\u00a0it the best chance of recovering.\nIf\u00a0a person is\u00a0dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol\u00a0support services.\nA\u00a0liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn't improve when you stop drinking alcohol.\nYou'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you've developed complications of\u00a0cirrhosis, despite having stopped drinking.

While they're unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it's best to get them checked out.\nDiagnosing anal cancer\nYour GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations.\nThey may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your\u00a0bottom so they can\u00a0feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you\u00a0to hospital if they think further tests are necessary.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its\u00a02015 guidelines that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump\u00a0or\u00a0anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within two weeks.\nIf you're referred to\u00a0hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions.\nSome of the tests you may have include a:\n\nsigmoidoscopy \u2013\u00a0where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities\nproctoscopy \u2013\u00a0where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end\nbiopsy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope\u00a0\n\nIf these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to \"stage\" the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.\nYou can read more about the\u00a0stages of anal cancer on the\u00a0Cancer Research UK website.\nHow anal cancer is treated\nIf you're diagnosed with anal cancer, you'll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. This is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care.\nThe main treatments used for anal cancer are:\n\nchemoradiation \u2013 a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy\nsurgery \u2013 to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel\n\nIn cases where the cancer has spread and can't be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. This is known as palliative care.\nThe main treatments are described in more detail below.\nChemoradiation\nChemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where\u00a0radiation\u00a0is used to kill cancer cells). It's currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. You don't usually need to stay in hospital when you're having chemoradiation.\nChemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in two cycles, each lasting four to five days, with a four-week gap between the cycles. In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your\u00a0treatment has finished.\nThe tube means you don't need to stay in\u00a0hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you'll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you.\nA few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC.\nRead more about\u00a0how chemotherapy is carried out\nRadiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for five to six weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required.\nRead more about how radiotherapy is carried out\nBoth chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including:\n\ntiredness\nsore skin around the anus\nsore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women\nhair loss\u00a0\u2013 limited hair loss from the head, but total loss from the pubic area\nfeeling sick\ndiarrhoea\n\nThese side effects are usually temporary, but there's also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility. If you're concerned about the potential side effects of treatment, you should discuss this with your care team before treatment begins.\u00a0\nOther possible long-term side effects can include:\n\nbowel control problems\nlong-term (chronic)\u00a0diarrhoea\nerectile dysfunction\nvaginal pain when having sex\ndry and itchy skin around the groin and anus\nbleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladder\n\nTell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated.\nSurgery\nSurgery is a less common treatment option\u00a0for anal cancer. It's usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily\u00a0removed, or if chemoradiation hasn't worked.\nIf the tumour is very small and clearly defined,\u00a0it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under general anaesthetic, that usually only requires a\u00a0stay in hospital of a few days.\nIf chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.\nAn\u00a0abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You'll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery.\nDuring the operation,\u00a0a\u00a0permanent colostomy will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a\u00a0section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation.\nBefore and after the operation, you'll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time.\nRead more about living with a colostomy\nFollow-up\nAfter your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have\u00a0regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.\nTo start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they'll gradually\u00a0become less frequent over time.\nWhat causes anal cancer?\nThe exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\ninfection with human papilloma virus (HPV)\u00a0\u2013 a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body\nhaving anal sex or lots of\u00a0sexual partners \u2013 possibly because this increases your risk of\u00a0developing HPV\nhaving a history of cervical, vaginal or vulval cancer\nsmoking\nhaving a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, if you have HIV\n\nYour risk of developing anal cancer increases as you get older, with half of all cases diagnosed in people aged 65 or over. The condition is also slightly more common in women than men.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for anal cancer depends on how advanced the condition is when it's diagnosed. The earlier it's diagnosed, the better the outlook.\nCompared with many other types of cancer,\u00a0the outlook for anal cancer is generally better because treatment\u00a0is often very effective. Around 66 out of 100 people (66%)\u00a0with anal cancer will live at least five years after diagnosis, and many will live much longer than this.\u00a0There are about 300 deaths from anal cancer each year in the UK.\nFurther information\u00a0about anal cancer\n\nCancer Research UK: anal cancer\nMacmillan:\u00a0anal cancer\n\n"}, {"Name": "Anaphylaxis", "Information": "\nAnaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly.\nIt is also known as anaphylactic shock.\nSigns of anaphylaxis include:\n\nitchy skin or a raised, red skin rash\nswollen eyes, lips, hands and feet\nfeeling lightheaded or faint\nswelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties\nwheezing\nabdominal pain, nausea and vomiting\ncollapse and unconsciousness\n\nWhat to do\nAnaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency.

This is a perfectly normal part of growing up, but has the\u00a0potential to become a phobia\u00a0(a type of anxiety disorder) when the fear becomes overwhelming and\u00a0affects your child's day-to-day life.\nRead about phobias\nFeeling anxious for most of the time for no apparent reason\nWhile\u00a0it's normal for children to frequently have fears and\u00a0worries, some anxious children may grow up to develop a long-term condition called generalised anxiety disorder when they become a teenager or young adult.\nGeneralised anxiety disorder causes you to\u00a0feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event.\nPeople\u00a0affected by it\u00a0feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed.\nSeparation anxiety\nSeparation anxiety means a child worrying about not being with their parent or regular carer.\nIt is common in young children, and normally develops at about six months of age. It can make settling into\u00a0nursery or school or with a child minder very difficult.\nSeparation anxiety in older children may be a sign that they\u2019re feeling insecure about something \u2013 they could be reacting to changes at home, for example.\nSocial anxiety\nSocial anxiety is not wanting to go out in public, see friends or\u00a0take part in activities.\nSocial 'shyness' is perfectly normal for some children and teenagers, but it becomes a problem \u2013 'social anxiety disorder' \u2013 when everyday activities like shopping\u00a0or speaking on the phone cause intense, overwhelming fear. Children affected by it\u00a0tend to fear doing or saying something they think will be humiliating.\nSocial anxiety disorder tends to affect older children who have gone through puberty.\nSchool-based anxiety\nSome children become anxious about going to school, schoolwork, friendships or bullying,\u00a0especially if they're changing school or moving up a level.\nThey may not always share these worries with you, and\u00a0instead complain of tummy aches or feeling sick. One of the signs is crying or seeming tired in the morning.\u00a0\nThis may be a problem that needs tackling if it is significantly affecting their daily life (see below).\nLess common anxiety disorders\nPost-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder are other anxiety disorders that can occasionally affect children, but are usually seen in adults.\nWhen is anxiety a disorder that needs treating?\nIt is probably time to get professional help for your child's anxiety if:\n\nyou feel it is not getting better or is getting worse, and efforts to tackle it yourself have not worked\nyou think it's slowing down their development or having a significant effect on their schooling or relationships\u00a0\nit happens very frequently\n\nHow serious can it be?\nLong-term anxiety can\u00a0severely interfere with a child's personal development, family life and\u00a0schooling.\nAnxiety disorders that start in childhood often persist into the teenage years and early adulthood. Teenagers with an anxiety disorder are more likely to develop clinical depression, misuse drugs and feel suicidal.\nThis is why\u00a0you should\u00a0get help as soon as you realise it's a problem.\nWhere should I go for help?\nYou can talk to your GP on your own or with your child, or your child might be able to have an appointment without you. The doctor should listen to your concerns and offer some advice about what to do next.\nYour child may be referred to the local\u00a0child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS), where the workers are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems. Professionals who work in CAMHS services include psychologists, psychiatrists and psychotherapists. They should offer help and support to parents and carers as well as the child.\nMore about\u00a0CAMHS\u00a0from Young Minds\nYouth counselling services\u00a0\nIf your child doesn't want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help from a local youth counselling service.\nYouth counselling services are specially set up for young people to talk about what\u2019s worrying them, and get advice.\nFor more information,\u00a0search Scotland's Service Directory for mental health and wellbeing services in your area that can help young people.\u00a0\nTelephone or online help\nTelephone helplines or online services can be helpful for children and young people, who may feel it's easier to talk to someone who doesn\u2019t know them.\u00a0\nHow can an anxiety disorder be treated?\nThe type of treatment offered will depend on what is causing your child's anxiety.\nCounselling\nIt can be helpful for your child to talk in confidence\u00a0about what is worrying them to a trained person, especially as it's someone they don't know.\nIf your child\u00a0is being seen at CAMHS, they might see a child and adolescent psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. If they are at a youth counselling service, it will be a trained youth counsellor or psychotherapist.\nThese sessions\u00a0can help them work out what is making them anxious and how they can\u00a0work through the situation.\nCognitive behavioural therapy\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave.\nIt has been proven to help with anxiety that isn't severe, and is commonly offered to young people who are anxious.\nYour child will work with the therapist to find ways to change the way they think and find strategies for coping\u00a0in situations that make them anxious. They'll usually have 9-20 sessions.\nIt's not clear whether CBT is effective for children younger than six years of age.\nMedication\nIf your child's anxiety problem has not got better, your doctor may talk to you about trying medication.\nA type of antidepressant, called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), may help your child feel calmer and differently about things.\nAntidepressants usually take around two to four weeks to work properly, so you or your child may not notice the difference immediately.\nIt's natural to be concerned about side effects. Your child should be aware of any possible adverse effects and should tell you or their doctor if they happen.\u00a0\nWhat can I do to help my child?\nIf a child is experiencing anxiety, there is plenty parents and carers can do to help. First, it's important to talk to your child about their anxiety or worries.\nWhy are some children affected and others not?\nSome children are simply born more nervous and anxious and less able to cope with stress than other children.\nA\u00a0child's anxious personality may be partly determined by the genes they've inherited from their parents. Parents of anxious children may recognise the signs and remember feeling and behaving the same when they were younger.\nStressful environment\nChildren can pick up anxious behaviour from being around anxious people.\nSome children can also develop anxiety after a series of stressful events. They may be able to cope with one of these events, but several difficult events together may be too much for them to cope with. Examples are:\n\nFrequently moving house and school \u2013 it can be hard to settle when you're always expecting change\nDivorce or separation of parents, especially when there are new step parents and siblings (although many children will adapt to this and settle in time)\nParents fighting or arguing\nDeath of a close relative or friend\nBecoming seriously illor injured in an accident\nHaving someone in the family who is ill or disabled\nSchool-related issues such as homework or exams, or\u00a0bullying or friendship problems\nBecoming involved in crime\nBeing abused or neglected\n\nMedical conditions\nChildren with certain conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorders may experience anxiety as part of the symptoms of their condition, because of differences in the way their brain functions.\nHow common are anxiety disorders in children?\nNearly 300,000 young people in Britain have an anxiety disorder.\u00a0\nIn the UK, anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 5-19% of all children and adolescents, and about 2-5% of children younger than 12.\nSeparation anxiety is the most common anxiety disorder in children younger than 12.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"Name": "Appendicitis", "Information": "\nAppendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix. The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5-10cm (2-4 inches) long. It's connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed.\nNobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn't harmful.\nAppendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.\nWithin hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe.\nPressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience diarrhoea.\nRead more about the symptoms of appendicitis.\nWhen to get medical help\nIf you're experiencing abdominal pain that's gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local\u00a0out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren't available, call NHS 24 111 Service for advice.\nYou should call 999 for an ambulance if you have sudden pain that continues to get worse and spreads across your abdomen.\nThese are signs your appendix may have burst, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.\nRead more about:\u00a0\ndiagnosing appendicitis\u00a0\ncomplications of appendicitis\nHow appendicitis is treated\nIn most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible.\nRemoval of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent.\nThe operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted.\nOpen surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult.\nMost people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6\u00a0weeks after open surgery.\u00a0\nRead more\u00a0about treating appendicitis.\nWhat causes appendicitis?\nIt's not exactly clear what the causes of appendicitis are. Most cases are thought to occur when something\u00a0blocks the entrance of the appendix.\nFor example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of\u00a0faeces or an upper\u00a0respiratory tract infection\u00a0could lead to\u00a0a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel.\nThis obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting.\nAs the causes aren't fully understood, there's no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis.\nWho's affected?\nAppendicitis is a common condition. Around 40,000 people are admitted to hospital with appendicitis each year in England.\nIt's estimated around\u00a01 in every 13 people develop it at some point in their life.\nAppendicitis can develop at any age, but it's most common in young people aged from 10 to 20 years old.\n"}, {"Name": "Arthritis", "Information": "\nArthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint.\nIn the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people\u00a0of all ages, including children (see below).\nTypes of arthritis\nThe two most common types of arthritis are:\n\nosteoarthritis\nrheumatoid arthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis\nOsteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people.\nIt most often develops in\u00a0adults who are in their late 40s or older. It's also more common in women and\u00a0people with a family history of\u00a0the condition.\u00a0However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other\u00a0joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.\nOsteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.\nOnce the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes.\nSevere loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.\nThe most commonly affected joints\u00a0are those in the:\n\nhands\nspine\nknees\nhips\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\nIn the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men.\nRheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.\u00a0\nThe outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This\u00a0may cause the\u00a0bone and cartilage to break down.\nPeople with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.\u00a0\nOther types of arthritis and related conditions\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis \u2013 a long-term inflammatory\u00a0condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together.\u00a0Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints.\nCervical spondylosis \u2013 also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness.\nFibromyalgia \u2013 causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons.\nLupus \u2013 an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues.\nGout \u2013 a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe) but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness\u00a0and swelling.\nPsoriatic arthritis \u2013 an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with\u00a0psoriasis.\nEnteropathic arthritis \u2013 a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the two best-known types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. About one in\u00a0five people with Crohn's or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. The most common areas affected by inflammation are\u00a0the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine.\nReactive arthritis \u2013 this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through).\u00a0It develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection.\nSecondary arthritis \u2013 a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica \u2013 a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and\u00a0stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause\u00a0joint inflammation.\n\nSymptoms of arthritis\nThe\u00a0symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have.\nThis is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have:\n\njoint pain, tenderness and stiffness\ninflammation in and around the joints\nrestricted movement of the\u00a0joints\nwarm, red skin over the affected joint\nweakness and\u00a0muscle wasting\n\nArthritis and children\nArthritis is often associated with older people, but\u00a0it can also\u00a0affect children. In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis.\nMost types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and\u00a0inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks.\nAlthough the exact cause of JIA is\u00a0unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life.\nThe main types of JIA are discussed below. Arthritis Research UK has more information about the different types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\nOligo-articular JIA\nOligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body\u00a0\u2013\u00a0most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists.\nOligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there's a risk that children\u00a0with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular\u00a0eye\u00a0tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended.\nPolyarticular JIA (polyarthritis)\nPolyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood.\nThe symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above.\nSystemic onset JIA\nSystemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can\u00a0become swollen and inflamed.\nLike polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age.\nEnthesitis-related arthritis\nEnthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone.\nTreating arthritis\nThere's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition.\nFor osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including:\n\npainkillers\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\ncorticosteroids\n\nIn severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended:\n\narthroplasty (joint replacement)\narthodesis (joint fusion)\nosteotomy (where a\u00a0bone is cut and re-aligned)\n\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0how osteoarthritis is treated.\nTreatment for\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis aims\u00a0to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is\u00a0to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include:\n\nanalgesics (painkillers)\ndisease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a combination of treatments is often recommended\nphysiotherapy\u00a0\nregular exercise\u00a0\n\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0how rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0is treated.\nFurther information and support\nRead more information about:\n\nliving with arthritis\narthritis\u00a0on\u00a0Arthritis Research UK\u00a0\nmanaging arthritis\u00a0on\u00a0Arthritis Care\n\n"}, {"Name": "Asbestosis", "Information": "\nAsbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos.\nAsbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. In the past, it was widely used in construction.\nAsbestos can\u00a0be very dangerous.\u00a0It does not present a health risk if it is undisturbed, but if material containing asbestos\u00a0is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate,\u00a0it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres.\nWhen the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage\u00a0them over time. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary.\u00a0However, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure.\nRead more about the causes of asbestosis.\nSymptoms of asbestosis\nBreathing in asbestos fibres may eventually scar the lungs of some people, which can lead to a number of symptoms, including:\n\nshortness of breath \u2013 this may only occur after physical\u00a0activity at first, but it\u00a0can eventually become a more constant problem\na persistent\u00a0cough\nwheezing\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nchest pain\nin more advanced cases,\u00a0clubbed (swollen) fingertips\n\nNowadays, most people who are diagnosed with asbestosis were exposed many years ago, before there were effective controls on exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace.\nSee your GP if you have the above symptoms and you think you may have been exposed to asbestos in the past.\nRead more about diagnosing asbestosis.\nTreating asbestosis\nThere is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs.\nOne of the\u00a0most important things someone with the condition can do is to\u00a0stop smoking,\u00a0if they smoke. This is because\u00a0the symptoms\u00a0are more\u00a0likely to get worse in people who smoke, and\u00a0smoking also increases the risk of lung cancer\u00a0in people with asbestosis.\nIf necessary, treatments such as oxygen therapy\u00a0can improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis.\nRead more about treating asbestosis.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for asbestosis can vary significantly, depending on the extent of damage to the lungs and whether any other conditions are present.\nAsbestosis can get worse over time and severe cases can place a significant strain on a person's health and shorten their life expectancy,\u00a0but in many cases the condition progresses very slowly or not at all.\nHowever, people with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:\n\npleural disease \u2013 where the membrane covering the lungs (pleura) becomes thicker, which can further contribute to breathlessness and chest discomfort\nmesothelioma \u2013 a type of cancer that affects the membrane that covers the lungs, heart and gut\nlung cancer\n\nOverall, more people with asbestosis die as a result of one of the cancers mentioned above, or from natural causes, than from asbestosis itself.\nCompensation\nIf you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, you may be able to claim compensation. This can be done through:\n\nindustrial injuries disablement benefit \u2013 this is\u00a0a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed)\na civil claim for compensation through the courts \u2013\u00a0you will need to obtain legal advice about how to do this\na claim for a lump compensation sum under the\u00a0Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 \u2013\u00a0if you have asbestosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and\u00a0you haven't been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you (or the person on whose behalf you are claiming) has ceased trading\n\nRead more about industrial injuries disablement benefit on the GOV.UK website.\nPreventing asbestosis\nThere are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. Two of these \u2013 called crocidolite and amosite \u2013 were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999.\nHowever, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings.\nIt's therefore\u00a0important to take precautions to reduce your risk of inhaling asbestos fibres if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos.\nIf you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos,\u00a0you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. Do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself.\nIf your job means\u00a0you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of what you can do to reduce your risk. Do not\u00a0attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely.\nRead about preventing asbestosis.\nWho is affected\nAsbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years.\nHowever, in 2011 there were 178 deaths directly caused by asbestosis and 429 where the condition was thought to have played a role. 980 new cases were assessed for industrial injuries disablement benefit during 2012.\n"}, {"Name": "Asthma", "Information": "\nAsthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness.\nThe severity of these symptoms varies from person to person.

If this happens you can develop bacterial vaginosis.\nBacteria other than lactobacilli overgrow in the vagina and usually cause symptoms.\nBacterial vaginosis can\u2019t be passed from person to person but it's more common in people who are sexually active.\nOther things that may increase your risk of getting it include:\n\nHaving a new sexual partner\nHaving multiple sexual partners\nSmoking\nUsing scented soaps or perfumed bubble bath\nPutting antiseptic liquids in the bath\nDouching (washing or cleaning out the vagina with water or other fluids)\nUsing vaginal deodorant\nUsing strong detergents to wash your underwear\n\nSymptoms of bacterial vaginosis\nOften there are no symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, but some women may notice a change in the normal discharge from the vagina.\nThis discharge will usually be white or grey, thin or watery and have a strong, unpleasant fishy smell. This can be more noticeable during and after sex, and during periods.\nBacterial vaginosis does not usually cause itching or irritation.\nTesting for bacterial vaginosis\nIf you think you have bacterial vaginosis you can make an appointment with your GP or local Sexual Health Services.\nYour nurse or doctor may use a swab to collect a sample of the discharge from your vagina.\nA swab looks a bit like a cotton bud and collecting a sample only takes a few minutes. Although not painful, it may be a little uncomfortable for a moment.\nA specially coated paper may be used to test the pH (alkaline/acid balance) of your vagina.\nSometimes a diagnosis can be made straightaway because of the distinctive appearance of the discharge or sometimes the sample will be sent to a lab for testing.\nTreatment for bacterial vaginosis\nBacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotics. An antibiotic cream or gel to use in the vagina may be given instead of antibiotic tablets by mouth.\nWhilst you're there, make sure you tell the doctor or nurse if you are pregnant or think you might be, or if you are breastfeeding - it may also affect the type of treatment you are given.\nAvoiding passing on bacterial vaginosis to a partner\nYou can still have sex whilst you are being treated for bacterial vaginosis because it's not sexually transmitted. However, antibiotics and cream can affect condoms and other contraception, so speak to your doctor or pharmacist who can give you more information.\nReducing the risk of getting bacterial vaginosis\nThe causes of bacterial vaginosis are not fully understood, so it may not be possible to completely prevent it.

It's involved in the production of semen.\nThe prostate produces a thick, white fluid that's made into a thinner\u00a0liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen.\nIf the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can\u00a0affect how you pass urine and may cause:\n\ndifficulty starting urination\na frequent need to urinate\ndifficulty fully emptying the bladder\n\nIn some men, the symptoms are mild and don't require treatment.

These\u00a0include:\n\nurine or stool\u00a0samples\na wound culture\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing\nrespiratory secretion testing\u00a0\u2013\u00a0taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus\nblood pressure tests\nimaging studies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as an\u00a0X-ray,\u00a0ultrasound scan\u00a0or computerised tomography (CT) scan\n\nTreatments for sepsis\nIf sepsis is detected early\u00a0and hasn't affected vital organs yet, it may be possible to treat the infection at home with\u00a0antibiotics. Most people who have sepsis detected at this stage make a full recovery.\nAlmost all people with severe sepsis and septic shock require admission to hospital. Some people\u00a0may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU).\nBecause\u00a0of\u00a0problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill and the condition can be\u00a0fatal.\nHowever, sepsis is treatable\u00a0if it is\u00a0identified and treated quickly, and in most cases leads to a full recovery with no lasting problems.\nRead more\u00a0about treating sepsis.\nRecovering from sepsis\nSome people make a full recovery fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies, depending on:\n\nthe severity of the sepsis\nthe person's overall health\nhow much time was spent in hospital\nwhether treatment was needed in an ICU\n\nSome people experience long-term physical and/or psychological problems during their recovery period, such as:\n\nfeeling lethargic or excessively tired\nmuscle weakness\nswollen limbs or joint pain\nchest pain or breathlessness\n\nThese long-term problems are known as post-sepsis syndrome. Not everyone experiences these problems.\nWho's at risk?\nAnyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection, although some people are more vulnerable.\nPeople most at risk of sepsis include those:\n\nwith a medical condition or receiving medical treatment that weakens their immune system\nwho are already in hospital with a serious illness\nwho are very young or very old\nwho have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident\n\nRead more about the causes of sepsis.\nSepsis, septicaemia and blood poisoning\nAlthough sepsis is often referred to as either blood poisoning or septicaemia, these terms refer to the\u00a0invasion of bacteria into the bloodstream.\nSepsis can affect multiple organs or the entire body,\u00a0even without blood poisoning or septicaemia.\nSepsis can also be caused by viral or fungal infections, although bacterial infections are by far the most common cause.\n"}, {"Name": "Bone Cancer", "Information": "\nPrimary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones.

The two most common bone cancers to affect teenagers are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.\nOsteosarcoma\nOsteosarcomas are most likely to affect bones in the leg, especially around the knee joint, but they can affect any bone.\nEwing sarcoma\nEwing sarcoma can affect any bone, but it\u2019s most common in the pelvis (which is made up of the tail bone and the two hip bones), or in leg bones. Ewing sarcoma can sometimes start outside the bone in the soft tissue. This is called soft tissue Ewing sarcoma, and is treated in the same way. Sarcoma is the name for a cancer that starts in any connective tissue, such as muscle, fat or cartilage.\nIn this information we sometimes use the term \u2018bone tumour\u2019. This means the same as bone cancer.\nCauses\nWe don\u2019t know what causes bone cancer. Because it\u2019s more common in young people, doctors think that it may be linked to the changes that happen when bones are growing. There is lots of ongoing research into the possible causes.\nPeople often think a knock or injury might have caused bone cancer, but there\u2019s no evidence for this.\nRemember that nothing you\u2019ve done has caused the cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of bone cancer\nBone cancer symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. Many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains.\nThe main symptoms are:\n\npain\u00a0or tenderness. This may start as an ache that doesn\u2019t go away. It may be made worse by exercise or feel worse at night. If bone pain at night doesn\u2019t get better, it\u2019s important to get this checked out by your GP.\u00a0\nswelling around the affected area of bone. Swelling may not show up until the tumour is quite large. It isn\u2019t always possible to see or feel a lump if the affected bone is deep inside the body.\u00a0\nreduced movement. If the bone tumour is near a joint (like an elbow or knee), it can make it harder to move the joint. If it\u2019s in a leg bone, it may cause a limp. If it\u2019s in the backbone (spine), it may press on nerves and cause tingling and numbness in the legs or arms.\u00a0\na\u00a0broken bone.

Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer.\nCancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer.\nBowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK, with around 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year.\nAbout\u00a01 in every 20 people in the UK will develop bowel cancer\u00a0in their lifetime.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit\u00a0\u2013 such as more frequent, looser stools\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0abdominal (tummy) pain.\nHowever, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by\u00a0haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually\u00a0the result of\u00a0something you have eaten.\nAs almost 9\u00a0out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments.\nMost people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combinations of\u00a0symptoms:\n\na persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools\na persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain\nblood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage\nabdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss\n\nThe symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don't necessarily make you feel ill.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nRead about the symptoms of\u00a0bowel cancer, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary.\nYour doctor will probably carry out a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps.\nThey may also\u00a0arrange for a simple blood test to check for\u00a0iron deficiency anaemia\u00a0\u2013 this can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel that you haven't been aware of.\nIn some cases, your doctor may decide it is best for you to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms.\nMake sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age.\nRead more about diagnosing bowel cancer\nWho's at risk?\nIt's not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. These include:\n\nage \u2013 almost\u00a09 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over\ndiet \u2013 a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk\nweight \u2013 bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese\nexercise \u2013 being inactive increases the risk of getting bowel cancer\nalcohol and smoking \u2013 a high alcohol intake and smoking may increase your chances of getting bowel cancer\nfamily history \u2013 having a close relative (mother or father, brother or sister) who developed bowel cancer\u00a0under the age of\u00a050 puts you at a greater lifetime risk of developing the condition\n\nSome people have an increased risk of bowel cancer because they have another condition that affects their bowel, such as severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, over a long period of time.\nRead more about the causes of bowel cancer and preventing bowel cancer\nBowel cancer screening\nBowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland to help find bowel cancer early when it can often be cured. \nBowel screening involves taking a simple test at home every 2 years. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, as this could mean a higher chance of bowel cancer.\nRead more about screening for bowel cancer\nTreatment and outlook\nBowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread.\nThe main treatments are:\n\nsurgery \u2013\u00a0the cancerous section of bowel is removed; it is the most effective way of curing bowel cancer, and is all that many people need\nchemotherapy \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells\u00a0\nradiotherapy \u2013 where radiation is used to kill cancer cells\nbiological treatments \u2013 a newer type of medication that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreading\n\nAs with most types of cancer, the chances of a complete cure depends on how far\u00a0it\u00a0has advanced by the time it is diagnosed. If the cancer is confined to the bowel, surgery will usually be able to completely remove it.\nOverall, 7 to 8 in every 10 people with bowel cancer will live at least one year after diagnosis. More than half of those diagnosed will live at least another 10 years. Every year, around 16,000 people die as a result of bowel cancer.\nRead more about how bowel cancer is treated and living with bowel cancer\n"}, {"Name": "Bowel Incontinence", "Information": "\nBowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. It's also sometimes known as faecal incontinence.\nThe experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person.

They are common, affecting 15-20% of the UK population, and don't usually cause symptoms.\nPolyps are usually less than 1cm in size, although they can grow up to several centimetres. There are various forms:\n\nsome are a tiny raised area or bulge, known as\u00a0a sessile polyp\nsome\u00a0look like a grape on a stalk, known as a pedunculated polyp\nsome take the form of many tiny bumps clustered together\n\nBowel polyps\u00a0are not usually cancerous, although\u00a0if they're discovered they'll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated.\nSome people just develop one polyp, while others may have a few.\u00a0They tend to occur in people over the age of 60.\nHow are they caused?\nBowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. The lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly.\nThere may be a family tendency towards developing bowel polyps or bowel cancer.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nMost people with polyps won't be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident.\nHowever, some larger polyps can cause:\n\na small amount of rectal bleeding\u00a0(blood in your stool)\nmucus to be produced when you open your bowels\ndiarrhoea\u00a0or constipation\nabdominal pain\n\nHow are they discovered?\nBowel polyps\u00a0are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or during screening for bowel cancer.\nIf polyps are found, a colonoscopy or CT colonography\u00a0is needed to view the whole of the large bowel and remove any polyps.\nHow are they treated?\nThere are several methods for treating polyps, but the most common procedure involves snaring the polyp\u00a0during a colonoscopy. Snaring is like cutting the polyp off with cheese wire and is painless.\nBoth of the above methods involve passing a flexible instrument called a colonoscope through your bottom and\u00a0up into your bowel. The colonoscope has a wire with an electric current to either cauterise (burn off) or snare the polyp.\nIn rare cases, polyps may need to be treated by surgically removing part of the bowel. This is usually only done when the polyp has some cell changes or is particularly large.\nAfter the polyp or polyps have been removed, they are sent to specialists in a laboratory, who will inform your consultant if:\n\nthe polyp has been completely removed\nthere is any risk of it regrowing\nthere is any cancerous change in the polyp\n\nIf there is a cancerous change in the polyp, you may need further treatment (depending on the degree and extent of change). Your specialist will be able to advise you on this.\nOutlook\nSome people will need further colonoscopies because polyps can recur. Polyps can sometimes run in families. This is uncommon, but\u00a0means you'll need colonoscopy checks at regular intervals.\nYou might be asked to have repeat examinations at intervals of around 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0years to catch any further polyps that may develop and potentially turn into bowel cancer.\n"}, {"Name": "Brain Stem Death", "Information": "\nBrain stem death is when a person no longer has any brain stem functions, and has permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe.\nWhen this happens, a\u00a0ventilator keeps the person's heart beating and oxygen circulating through their bloodstream.\nA person is confirmed as being dead when their brain stem function is permanently lost.\nConfirming death\nConfirming death used to be straightforward. Death was said to occur when the heart stopped beating and a person was unresponsive and no longer breathing. The lack of oxygen, which occurred as a result of no blood flow, quickly led to the permanent loss of brain stem function.\nConfirming death is now more complex, because it's possible to keep the heart beating after the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning. This can be done by keeping a person on a ventilator, which allows the body and\u00a0heart to be artificially oxygenated. However, that person won't ever regain consciousness or start breathing again.\nOnce the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning, there's no way of reversing it and the heart will eventually stop beating, even if a ventilator continues to be used.\nTo save a person's family and friends from unnecessary suffering, once there's clear evidence that brain death has occurred, the person will be disconnected from the\u00a0ventilator.\nThe brain stem\nThe brain stem is the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column).\nThe brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body's automatic functions that are essential for life. These include:\n\nbreathing\nheartbeat\nblood pressure\nswallowing\n\nThe brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain\u2019s core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement.\nAfter\u00a0brain death, it's not possible for someone to remain conscious.\nHow brain death occurs\nBrain death can occur when the blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. This can be caused by:\n\ncardiac arrest \u2013 when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen\nheart attack \u2013 a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked\nstroke \u2013 a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted\nblood clot \u2013 a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your body\n\nBrain death can also occur as a result of:\n\na\u00a0severe head injury\na brain haemorrhage\ninfections, such as encephalitis\na\u00a0brain tumour\u00a0\n\nVegetative state\nThere's a difference between brain death and a\u00a0vegetative state, which can occur after extensive brain damage.\nSomeone in a vegetative state can show signs of wakefulness \u2013 for example, they may open their eyes, but not respond to their surroundings.\nIn rare cases, a person may demonstrate some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings.\nHowever, the important difference between brain death and a vegetative state is that someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means that:\n\nsome form of consciousness may exist\nbreathing unaided is usually possible\u00a0\nthere's a slim chance of recovery, because the brain stem's core functions may be unaffected\n\nA\u00a0person who is brain dead has no chance of recovery, because their body is unable to survive without artificial support.\nConfirming brain death\nAlthough rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead.\nThese include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe\u00a0hypothermia (where body temperature drops below 28C).\nTherefore, a number of tests are carried out to check that brain death has actually occurred, such as shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light.\nOrgan donation\nAfter brain death has occurred,\u00a0it may be possible for the person's organs to be used in transplantations, which can often save the lives of others.\nIn cases where a deceased person hasn't made their wishes clear, deciding whether to donate their organs can be a difficult decision for partners and relatives. Hospital staff are aware of these difficulties and will try to ensure\u00a0the issue is handled sensitively and thoughtfully.\nRead more about organ donation\n"}, {"Name": "Brain Tumours", "Information": "\nA brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way.

The links above will take you to more information about the specific types.\nSymptoms of a brain tumour\nThe symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain that's affected. Common symptoms include:\n\nsevere, persistent\u00a0headaches\nseizures (fits)\npersistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness\nmental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality\nprogressive weakness or\u00a0paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems\n\nSometimes, you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may only develop very slowly over time.\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP if you\u00a0have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nIf your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.\nWho is affected\nBrain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.\nMore than 9,000 people are diagnosed with primary\u00a0brain tumours in the UK each year, of\u00a0which about half\u00a0are benign and half are malignant. Many others\u00a0are diagnosed\u00a0with secondary brain tumours.\nThe exact reason why some people develop primary brain tumours is unknown,\u00a0but it's thought that certain genetic conditions \u2013 such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis\u00a0\u2013 and previous radiotherapy\u00a0to the head increase\u00a0your risk.\nTreatment and outlook\nThe main treatment for most brain tumours is surgery, which aims to remove as much of the abnormal tissue as possible.\nIt's not always possible to remove the entire tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may be necessary to kill any abnormal cells left behind.\nFor most benign tumours, treatment is often\u00a0successful and a full recovery is possible, although there's sometimes a small chance the tumour could come back.\u00a0Regular follow-up appointments will normally be recommended to monitor this.\nThe outlook for malignant tumours is generally less good, although this varies depending on things such as\u00a0where the tumour is in the brain, your age, and your general health. Unfortunately,\u00a0a cure is often not possible and most tumours will return after treatment.\nIf a tumour does come back, treatment\u00a0will aim to relieve your symptoms and prolong life by controlling the growth of the tumour.\u00a0\nSupport and further information\nAs well as reading the separate pages on\u00a0benign brain tumours\u00a0and malignant brain tumours, you may find the following websites useful sources of information and support:\n\nThe Brain Tumour Charity\nBrain Tumour Research\nCancer Research UK: brain tumours\u00a0\nMacmillan: brain tumours\n\n"}, {"Name": "Brain Tumours Children", "Information": "\nBrain tumours are the most common tumours that develop in children.

This information is about primary brain tumours.\nSigns and symptoms\nThese will depend on the size of the tumour, where it is and how it affects that part of the brain. Most commonly, children present with symptoms described below. These are caused by the pressure inside the head being higher than it should be: a growing tumour may push normal brain out of the way, or block the flow of fluid in the brain. Doctors call this raised intracranial pressure, and it can cause symptoms such as:\n\nheadaches (often worse in the morning)\nvomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick\nfits (seizures)\nfeeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things\neye problems, such as abnormal eye movements, blurring or double vision feeling very tired much more quickly than usual\nfeeling extremely sleepy (drowsy) for no reason\n\nBrain tumours can also cause problems with balance and walking, weakness down one side of the body, or changes in behaviour. Some of these symptoms are common even without a brain tumour, and this can cause confusion in the early stages.\nThe brain\nThe brain is contained within the skull, which protects it. Between the brain and the skull, there are three layers of membrane called the meninges. These completely cover the brain and spinal cord and help to protect it. Between two of these layers is a space that contains a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which circulates around the brain and spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0The main parts of the brain are:\n\nthe cerebrum - this is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. It is made up of two halves or hemispheres. It controls thinking, learning, memory, problem-solving, emotions and touch. It also helps us be aware of our body position\nthe cerebellum - this is the back part of the brain, and it controls movement, balance and coordination\nthe brain stem - this connects the brain to the spinal cord and is in the lower part of the brain just above the back of the neck. It controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing\n\nWhat happens when a brain tumour is suspected\nKnowing what a test involves can make things a bit easier. The specialist doctor and nurse will explain things but don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions.\nYour doctor will want to hear about the problems your child has had recently, and will examine him or her properly. This will include looking into the back of your child\u2019s eyes with an ophthalmoscope to check for swelling, which can be a sign of raised pressure in the brain. They\u2019ll usually check other things like balance, coordination, sensation and reflexes.\nCT or MRI scan\nMost children will have a CT or an MRI scan, which looks in detail at the inside of the brain.\nA CT scan uses X-rays. It is quick and often is the best first-line investigation, but it does not give as detailed pictures as an MRI. It uses quite a lot of X-rays, and so it is important to make sure we do not use it on too many people if it can be avoided.\nAn MRI scan uses no X-rays, and gives more detailed pictures, but takes much longer. Machines are noisy, and often children cannot lie still long enough to get proper images. It is sometimes necessary to have an anaesthetic for this scan.\nOrdinary X-rays are not usually helpful for brain tumours.\nBlood tests\nThese are usually done to make sure it is safe to do an operation, and can also be used to help diagnose certain types of tumour.\nBiopsy\nIt is often necessary for doctors to remove a small part of the tumour (biopsy) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. It means your child will need to go into hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic. The piece of tumour removed is then examined under a microscope by a specialist doctor called a pathologist.\nA biopsy isn\u2019t always done; it is sometimes better to remove the whole tumour in one operation. In this case, it will be a few days before the exact type of tumour is known.\nSometimes, it may be safer to do the operation in two stages. Part of the tumour might be removed in the first operation and the rest a few days later.\nTypes of brain tumours\nThere are different types of brain tumours and they are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. The main types are astrocytoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma, but there are many other, less common types.\nBrain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).\nBenign brain tumours\nThese remain in the part of the brain that they started in and do not usually spread into other areas. Sometimes it may be difficult to remove a benign tumour, because of where it is and, in this situation, other treatments may be needed.\nThe most common tumour of this type is a low-grade astrocytoma (also called low-grade glioma).\nMalignant primary brain tumours\nThese are most likely to cause problems by causing pressure and damage to the areas around them and possibly by spreading to the normal brain tissue close by.\nThe main types that affect children are:\nHigh-grade astrocytoma and ependymoma\nThese tumours develop from the supporting cells of the brain known as glial cells, and are sometimes also called gliomas.\nMedulloblastomas\nThese usually develop in the lower part of the brain, the cerebellum. They may spread to other parts of the brain or into the spinal cord, and treatment must include the whole of this.\nTreatment\nBecause there are different types of brain tumours, treatment will not be the same for everyone. The doctors will look at the type of brain tumour, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment.\nThese are the main treatments used to treat brain tumours. Your child may have one treatment or a combination of treatments:\nSurgery\nUsually, a neurosurgeon will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible. Operations can be very long \u2013 it is not uncommon for these to be more than six or eight hours \u2013 so you should not become unduly worried by this.\nSometimes, the fluid in and around the brain does not flow freely, as a result of the tumour or brain swelling. In this case, it may be necessary to place a fine tube (shunt) to drain excess fluid from the brain and into the lining of the tummy area (abdomen). You cannot see the shunt outside the body. Another way of treating this is to create another drainage route for the fluid around the obstruction (called a ventriculostomy).\nFrontal lobe (thinking, memory, behaviour and movement) Temporal lobe (hearing, learning and feelings) Brain stem (breathing, heart rate and temperature) Cerebellum (balance and coordination) Occipital lobe (sight) Parietal lobe (language and touch) Areas of the brain Illustration reproduced with permission from Macmillan Cancer Support\nAfter the operation, your child may spend some time in an intensive care ward or high dependency unit, so the nurses and doctors can keep a very close eye on them.\nOnce a diagnosis is known, a plan to treat any tumour left behind can be made. For benign tumours, there may be no further treatment, but for some, radiotherapy or chemotherapy will be required.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy radiation beams. These are exactly the same as visible light, but instead of reflecting from the surface, the energy passes inside the body, where it causes damage to tumour cells.\nRadiotherapy is delivered extremely carefully, using machines linked to the MRI scans of your child\u2019s brain. The process usually takes a few minutes each time, but often needs to continue for five or six weeks.\nSometimes more specialised types of radiotherapy may be used. Your child\u2019s oncologist will explain more about this.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy uses drugs to get rid of cancer cells. Chemotherapy is given into the veins, and sometimes as a liquid or tablets by mouth. Treatment is often quite prolonged, with periods of time in hospital and gaps when you will be able to return home. This part of the treatment is planned by an oncologist.\nThe specialist doctor and nurse will explain your child\u2019s treatment and answer your questions so that you understand what is involved.\nOther medicines your child may need to take\nYour child may need to take medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour:\nSteroids\nThese are medicines that reduce swelling and inflammation in the brain and can help with symptoms.\nAnticonvulsants\nThese are medicines that help prevent fits, which can be a problem before or after operations on the brain. They may only be necessary for a short period, but sometimes are needed for longer.\nSide effects of treatment\nYour child\u2019s doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects your child is having. Many side effects can be well controlled or made easier.\nSome possible common side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy include:\nHair loss\nBoth radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause hair loss. Your child\u2019s hair will usually grow back again after chemotherapy, although it may not after radiotherapy.\nTiredness\nTiredness is very common with both treatments and may continue for weeks after chemotherapy or radiotherapy finishes.\nFeeling sick\nRadiotherapy and chemotherapy may make your child feel sick. This can usually be controlled well with anti-sickness drugs, which the oncologist will prescribe for your child.\nIncreased risk of an infection\nChemotherapy can increase the risk of infection, so it is important to contact the oncologist or specialist nurse straight away if your child has a temperature, any signs of infection or suddenly feels unwell.\nSkin changes in the treated area if your child is having radiotherapy\nRadiotherapy can cause a mild form of sunburn. The skin may become red, flaky or sore if your child has fair skin and may become darker and flaky if your child has dark skin. You\u2019ll be given advice on looking after the skin in the treated area.\nClinical trials\nTrials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. It is important to realise that a clinical trial is not an \u2018experiment\u2019, and your doctor will always offer you what is believed to be the best available treatment. Clinical trials are usually offered to explore ways of making new improvements to treatment, beyond what is already known.\nSpecialist doctors carry out many trials for brain tumours. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it is right for your child. You can also join a trial, and then withdraw if you change your mind at a later date.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nAfter treatment is over, your child will be seen regularly by specialists. This is to check their progress and how well they\u2019re recovering from treatment. It is also to check that they don\u2019t have any long-term problems from treatment.\nYou can contact your child\u2019s specialist doctor or nurse at any time if you have any worries about their health.\nLong-term side effects\nSometimes treatments may cause possible long-term side effects that may develop later. Your child\u2019s oncologist or specialist nurse will explain the possible risk of any long-term effects in your child\u2019s situation. Children are monitored for any long-term problems following treatment so that they can be picked up and managed early on.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Brain Tumours Teenagers And Young Adults", "Information": "\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults. It\u2019s about the brain and different types of brain tumour.\nAny illness to do with your brain can be scary. Understanding a bit more about how the brain works might help.\nThe brain\nThe brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is the \u2018control centre\u2019 which coordinates most body functions. It is inside the skull, which protects it. The spinal cord is made up of nerves that run down the spine. It passes messages between the brain and the rest of the body.\nThe brain and the spinal cord are covered by three thin layers of tissue called the meninges. Between two of these layers is a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The meninges and CSF help to protect the brain and spinal cord.\nThe main parts of the brain are:\n\n\nthe cerebrum\n\n\nthe cerebellum\n\n\nthe brain stem\n\n\nthe pituitary gland\n\n\nCerebrum\nThis is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. It\u2019s made up of two halves called hemispheres. It controls thinking, learning, memory, problem solving, emotions, and touch. It also makes us aware of our body position.\nCerebellum\nThis is at the back of the head, near the middle. It controls movement, balance and coordination.\nBrain stem\nThis connects the brain to the spinal cord. It\u2019s in the lower part of the brain, just above the back of the neck. It controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing.\nPituitary gland\nThis is in the middle of the brain. It makes hormones that control things such as growth, metabolism, periods in girls, and sperm production in guys.\nTypes of brain tumour\nThere are different types of brain tumour. They are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). This information is about both types.\nBenign brain tumours often press on the brain but don\u2019t usually spread into surrounding tissue. They are also less likely to spread around the brain and spinal cord. If they can be removed with an operation they may not cause any more problems. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to remove a benign tumour because of where it is in the brain. In this case, you might need treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nSome benign tumours can cause long-lasting changes. This can be because they increase the pressure inside the brain, or because they press on important areas of the brain.\nMalignant brain tumours can spread from where they started into surrounding brain tissue, causing pressure and problems in those parts of the brain. They can also spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into other parts of the brain or the spinal cord.\nThis information is about tumours that start in the brain, which are called primary brain tumours. Sometimes cancers that start in other parts of the body can spread to the brain. These are known as secondary brain tumours.\nThe types of brain tumour most likely to affect teenagers and young adults are:\n\n\npituitary tumours\n\n\ngliomas\n\n\nmedulloblastomas\n\n\ngerm cell tumours\n\n\nGliomas\nThese start in cells called glial cells. There are different types of glioma, but the ones that affect younger people are usually astrocytomas,\noligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. These types of tumour can develop in the brain or in the spinal cord.\nAstrocytomas\u00a0and oligodendrogliomas\nThese are the most common type of glioma.\nAstrocytomas develop from a star-shaped cell called an astrocyte. Oligodendrogliomas look like a fried egg. Sometimes tumours are a mix of both cells. These are called oligoastrocytomas. Doctors group them by how quickly they grow (known as the grade of the tumour). They can tell the grade from how the cells look under a microscope.\nEpendymomas\nThese are a rarer type of glioma. They develop from the spinal cord, and from cells that line the fluid-filled spaces (ventricles) in the brain. These tumours can spread to\u00a0other parts of the brain and spine through the CSF.\nPituitary tumours\nThese are usually benign tumours that grow in the pituitary gland. They are mostly grouped into pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas.\nSome cause too many or too few hormones to be produced in the body. They very rarely spread.\nMedulloblastomas\nThese usually start in the cerebellum, at the back of the brain. Sometimes they can spread through the CSF, or very rarely to other parts of the body. They start from cells that haven\u2019t properly developed yet, and are sometimes called primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET).\nGerm cell tumours of the brain\nThis type of tumour is rare. They develop from very early cells called germ cells, which have the potential to grow into any type of tissue.\nAlthough germ cell tumours often develop in the ovaries in girls or the testicles in boys, they can also start in other parts of the body, including the brain. They may be non-cancerous or cancerous. They are called by different names depending on what the cells look like under a microscope.\nWe also have more info about:\n\n\nsymptoms of brain tumours\n\n\nhaving tests for brain tumours\n\n\ntreatment for brain tumours\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for information about\u00a0brain tumours in people of all ages, please see our general brain tumours section.

Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also\u00a0get breast cancer.\nIf it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body.\n"}, {"Name": "Breast Cancer Male", "Information": "\nBreast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it.\nIt's\u00a0much less common in men than women, with only around\u00a01 new case of breast cancer diagnosed for every 100,000 men (about 350 to 400 cases) in the UK each year.\nThe cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts.\nHowever, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by\u00a0a condition called gynaecomastia.

Some people have only a few symptoms that don't appear often, while others have wide-ranging daily\u00a0symptoms.\nThe symptoms tend to get worse if you develop an infection in your lungs.\nRead more about the symptoms of bronchiectasis.\nWhen to see your GP\nYou should see your GP if you develop a persistent cough. While this may not be\u00a0caused by\u00a0bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation.\nIf your GP suspects you may have bronchiectasis, they'll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further tests.\nRead more about diagnosing bronchiectasis.\nHow the lungs are affected\nThe lungs are full of tiny branching airways, known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream.\nThe inside walls of the bronchi are coated with sticky mucus, which protects against damage from particles moving down into the lungs.\nIn bronchiectasis, one or more of the bronchi are abnormally widened. This means more mucus than usual gathers there, which makes the bronchi more vulnerable to infection. If an infection does develop, the bronchi may be damaged again, so even more mucus gathers in them, and the risk of infection increases further.\nOver time, this cycle can cause gradually worsening damage to the lungs.\nWhy it happens\nBronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed.\u00a0\nThere are many reasons why this may happen. The three most common causes in the UK\u00a0are:\n\na\u00a0lung infection during childhood, such as pneumonia or whooping cough, that damages the bronchi\nunderlying problems with the immune system (the body\u2019s defence against infection) that make the bronchi more vulnerable to damage from an infection\nallergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) \u2013 an allergy to a certain type of fungi that can cause the bronchi to become inflamed if spores from the fungi\u00a0are inhaled\n\nHowever, in many cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause for the condition can be found (known as idiopathic bronchiectasis).\nRead more about the causes of bronchiectasis.\nWho is affected\nBronchiectasis is thought to be uncommon. It's estimated that around 1 in every 1,000 adults in the UK have the condition.\nIt can affect anyone at any age, but\u00a0symptoms don't usually develop until middle age.\nOver 12,000\u00a0people\u00a0were admitted\u00a0to hospital in England during 2013-14 with bronchiectasis. The majority of these\u00a0people were over 60 years old.\nHow bronchiectasis is treated\nThe damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help relieve your symptoms and stop the damage getting worse.\nThe main treatments include:\n\nexercises and special devices\u00a0to help you clear mucus out of your\u00a0lungs\nmedication to help improve airflow within the lungs\nantibiotics to treat any lung infections that develop\n\nSurgery\u00a0is usually only considered for bronchiectasis in rare cases where other treatments haven't been effective, the damage to your bronchi is confined to a small area and you're in good general health.\nRead more about the treatment of bronchiectasis.\nPossible complications\nComplications of bronchiectasis are rare, but they can be serious. One of the most serious complications is coughing up large amounts of blood, caused\u00a0by one of the blood vessels in the lungs splitting. This problem can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery to treat it.\nRead more about the complications of bronchiectasis.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for people with bronchiectasis is highly variable and often depends on the underlying cause.\nLiving with bronchiectasis can be stressful and frustrating, but most people with the condition have a normal life expectancy. For people with very severe symptoms, however, bronchiectasis can be fatal if the lungs stop working properly.\nAround 1,000 deaths reported in England and Wales each year are thought to be\u00a0caused by\u00a0bronchiectasis.\nInformation about you\nIf you have\u00a0bronchiectasis, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register.\n"}, {"Name": "Bronchitis", "Information": "\nBronchitis is an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchi), causing them to become irritated and inflamed.\nThe main symptom is a cough, which may bring up yellow-grey mucus (phlegm). Bronchitis may also cause a\u00a0sore throat\u00a0and wheezing.\nRead more about the symptoms of bronchitis.\nWhen to see your GP\nMost cases of bronchitis can be treated easily at home with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and plenty of fluids.\nYou only need to see your GP if your symptoms are severe or unusual \u2013 for example, if:\n\nyour cough is severe or lasts longer than three weeks\nyou have a constant fever\u00a0(a temperature of 38\u00b0C\u00a0\u2013\u00a0100.4\u00b0F\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or above) for more than three days\nyou cough up mucus streaked with blood\nyou have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as\u00a0asthma or\u00a0heart failure\n\nYour GP may need to rule out other lung infections, such as pneumonia, which has symptoms similar to those of bronchitis. If your GP thinks you may have pneumonia, you will probably need a chest X-ray, and a sample of mucus may be taken for testing.\nIf your GP thinks you might have an undiagnosed underlying condition, they may also suggest a pulmonary function test. You will be asked to take a deep breath and blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures the volume of air in your lungs. Decreased lung capacity can indicate an underlying health problem.\nTreating bronchitis\nIn most cases, bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without the need for treatment. This type of bronchitis is known as \"acute bronchitis\". While you are waiting for it to pass, you should drink lots of fluid and get plenty of rest.\nIn some cases, the symptoms of bronchitis can last much longer. If symptoms last for at least three months, it is known as \"chronic bronchitis\". There is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but there are several medications to help relieve symptoms. It is also important to avoid smoking and smoky environments, as this can make your symptoms worse.\nRead more about treating bronchitis.\nWhy do I have bronchitis?\nThe bronchi are the main airways in your lungs, which branch off on either side of your windpipe (trachea). They lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs, known as bronchioles.\nThe walls of the bronchi produce mucus to trap dust and other particles that could otherwise cause irritation.\nMost cases of acute bronchitis\u00a0develop when an infection causes the bronchi to become irritated and inflamed, which causes them to produce more mucus than usual. Your body tries to shift this extra mucus through coughing.\nSmoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis. Over time, tobacco smoke can cause permanent damage to the bronchi, causing them to become inflamed.\nRead more about the causes of bronchitis.\nComplications\nPneumonia is the most common complication of bronchitis. It\u00a0happens when the\u00a0infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid.\u00a01 in 20 cases of bronchitis leads to pneumonia.\nPeople at an increased risk of developing pneumonia include:\n\nelderly people\npeople who smoke\npeople with other health conditions, such as heart, liver or kidney disease\npeople with a weakened immune system\n\nMild pneumonia can usually be treated with antibiotics at home. More severe cases may require admission to hospital.\nRead more about the treatment of pneumonia.\nWho is affected\nAcute bronchitis is one of the most common types of lung infection, and is one of the top five reasons for GP visits.\nAcute bronchitis can affect people of all ages, but is most common in younger children under the age of five. It is more common in winter, and often develops following a cold,\u00a0sore throat or flu.\nIt is estimated that there are around 2 million people in the UK affected by chronic bronchitis.

This can cause the skin and tissues over the big toe joint to thicken and become inflamed, swollen and painful. Sometimes a fluid filled sac (bursa) develops over the joint.\nHow they're diagnosed\nTo diagnose a bunion, a healthcare professional will ask you about it and examine your big toe.\nOther investigations may be considered, these can be discussed with your healthcare professional.\nTreating bunions\nWearing the right footwear is one of the best things you can do to help.\nChoose flat wide shoes that fit you properly. Ones with laces or an adjustable strap are best as they can adjust to the width of your foot.\nAvoid high-heeled, pointed or tight shoes.\nBunion pads\nBunion pads can give you some protection from the pressure of your shoes.\nYou can usually buy these from pharmacies, chiropodists and podiatrists.\nMedication\nMany people take medication to cope with their pain and symptoms, and help them remain active.\nYou may be prescribed pain medication to ease the pain. Make sure you take any medication as prescribed, and get advice from a GP, pharmacist or suitably trained healthcare professional.\nSurgery\nYou may be referred for assessment by an orthopaedic or podiatric surgeon if other treatments don't help and your bunion is very painful.\nAn operation won't return your foot to normal but most people find it reduces their symptoms and improves the shape of their foot.\nOther intervention\nThere are other health interventions which may be more appropriate for your condition.

You may also not have symptoms if the tumour is just in your digestive system, as any hormones it produces will be broken down by your liver.\nIf symptoms\u00a0do develop, they tend to be fairly general and can be easily mistaken for signs of other illnesses.\nSymptoms may result from both the tumour itself and from any hormones it releases into the bloodstream.\nSymptoms caused by the tumour\nSymptoms will depend\u00a0on where in the body the tumour develops:\n\nA\u00a0bowel carcinoid tumour may cause tummy pain, a blocked bowel (diarrhoea, constipation, feeling or being sick) and\u00a0bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding).\nA lung carcinoid tumour may cause a\u00a0cough, which may make you cough up blood, and cause wheezing, breathlessness,\u00a0chest pain and tiredness.\nA\u00a0stomach carcinoid tumour may cause pain, weight loss, tiredness and weakness.\n\nSome tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance. For example,\u00a0an appendix carcinoid tumour may only be\u00a0found when the appendix is being removed for another reason.\nSymptoms caused by the hormones (carcinoid syndrome)\nTypical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:\n\ndiarrhoea,\u00a0tummy pain and loss of appetite\nflushing\u00a0of the skin, particularly the face\nfast heart rate\nbreathlessness and wheezing\n\nThese symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.\nSome people may also develop\u00a0carcinoid heart disease, where\u00a0the heart valves thicken and\u00a0stop working properly. There is also a risk of developing a rare but serious reaction called\u00a0a carcinoid crisis, which involves severe flushing, breathlessness and a drop in blood pressure.\nWhat causes carcinoid tumours?\nIt's\u00a0not\u00a0known exactly\u00a0why carcinoid tumours develop, but it's thought that most\u00a0occur by chance.\nYour chances of developing a carcinoid tumour may be increased if you have:\n\na rare family syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)\nparents or siblings with a carcinoid tumour\nparents with squamous cell skin cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or cancer of the brain, breast, liver, womb, bladder or kidney\nconditions called neurofibromatosis or\u00a0tuberous sclerosis\n\nYou can read more about the\u00a0possible risk factors for carcinoid tumours\u00a0on the\u00a0Cancer Research UK website.\nDiagnosing carcinoid tumours\nA\u00a0carcinoid tumour may be found incidentally \u2013 for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix. In this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems.\nOtherwise, people usually see their GP after they have developed symptoms, and a carcinoid tumour may be diagnosed after carrying out a series of scans and tests, which may include measuring the\u00a0amount of\u00a0serotonin\u00a0in your urine and having an endoscopy.\nYou can read more about the\u00a0tests for carcinoid tumours\u00a0on the\u00a0Cancer Research UK website.\nTreating carcinoid tumours and carcinoid syndrome\nIf the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether. Otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking).\nYou can read more about the\u00a0surgery for carcinoid tumours\u00a0on the\u00a0Cancer Research UK website.\nIf the tumour cannot be removed, but it's not growing or causing symptoms, you may not need treatment straight away \u2013 it might just be carefully monitored.\u00a0\nIf it's causing symptoms, you may be offered one of the\u00a0following treatments:\n\ninjections of medicines called somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide and lanreotide, which can slow down the growth of the tumour\nradiotherapy\u00a0to kill some of the cancer cells\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Cancer Research UK has more information on the\u00a0two main options:\u00a0targeted radiotherapy and external beam radiotherapy\na procedure to block the blood supply to\u00a0the\u00a0tumour (for tumours in the liver), known as hepatic artery embolisation\na procedure that uses a heated probe to kill cancer cells (for tumours in the liver), called radiofrequency ablation\nchemotherapy to shrink the tumour and control your symptoms\n\nSymptoms of carcinoid syndrome can\u00a0be treated with injections of octreotide and lanreotide.\u00a0You may also be given\u00a0medication to widen your airways (to relieve wheezing and breathlessness) and anti-diarrhoea medication.\nWhat can I do to help myself?\nThere are things you can do yourself to manage some of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.\nGenerally, you should avoid triggers of flushing, such as:\n\nalcohol\nlarge meals\nspicy foods\nfoods containing the substance tyramine, such as aged cheese and salted or pickled meats\nstress\n\nSome medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, may make symptoms worse by further increasing your levels of serotonin \u2013 but never stop taking medication without seeking medical advice.\nIf you have diarrhoea, it's important to keep drinking little and often to avoid dehydration.\nOutlook\nIf the whole tumour can be removed, this may cure the cancer and symptoms altogether. But even if surgeons cannot remove the entire tumour, it usually grows slowly and can be controlled with medication.\nOverall,\u00a0people with carcinoid tumours\u00a0have a good life expectancy compared to many other cancers, with\u00a0around 70-80%\u00a0surviving at least five years from diagnosis. Many people remain relatively well and lead active lives, with only occasional symptoms.\nBut\u00a0as the tumour\u00a0grows or spreads, it will produce more and more hormones, and it may eventually be difficult to completely control symptoms with medication. You may need further surgery or other treatments.\nUnfortunately, life expectancy is not as good for cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, because it won't usually be possible to remove all of it. However, treatment can still control your symptoms and slow down the spread of cancer.\nYou can read more about the statistics and outlook for carcinoid\u00a0on the Cancer Research UK website.\nInformation about you\nIf you have carcinoid syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register\n"}, {"Name": "Catarrh", "Information": "\nCatarrh is a build-up of mucus in an airway or cavity of the body.\nIt usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses (air-filled cavities in the bones of the face).\nIt's often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years.

Some people find these helpful, but there's generally little scientific evidence to suggest they work.\nWhen to see your GP\nSpeak to your GP if your catarrh persists and is becoming difficult to live with.\nThey may want to rule out conditions that could be causing it, such as\u00a0nasal polyps\u00a0or allergies. This may mean you\u00a0need to be referred to a specialist for tests.\nIf you're diagnosed with a specific underlying\u00a0condition, treating it may help relieve your catarrh. For example, nasal polyps\u00a0may be treated with a steroid nasal spray, or in some cases surgery.\u00a0\nIf a cause for you catarrh cannot be found, the self-help techniques above may be recommended.\u00a0Unfortunately, however,\u00a0chronic catarrh can be hard to treat and may last for a long time.\nWhat causes catarrh?\nCatarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation, which causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus.\nThis\u00a0can be triggered by:\n\na\u00a0cold or other infections\nhay fever or other types of allergic rhinitis\nnon-allergic rhinitis\nnasal polyps\n\nIt's\u00a0unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it's not thought to be the result of an allergy or infection.\nIt may be related to an abnormality in the way mucus\u00a0travels within\u00a0the nose or an increased\u00a0sensitivity to mucus in the back of the\u00a0nose\u00a0and throat.\n"}, {"Name": "Cellulitis", "Information": "\n\nCellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and the underlying tissue.

If you do have symptoms,\u00a0the most common is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in between\u00a0periods or after the menopause.\nAbnormal bleeding doesn't mean that you definitely have cervical cancer, but it should be investigated by your GP as soon as possible. If your GP thinks you might have cervical cancer, you should be referred to see a specialist within two weeks.\nRead more about the symptoms of cervical cancer\u00a0and diagnosing cervical cancer\nScreening for cervical cancer\nOver the course of many years, the cells lining the surface of the cervix undergo a series of changes. In rare cases, these precancerous cells can become cancerous. However, cell changes in the cervix can be detected at a very early stage and treatment can reduce the risk of cervical cancer developing.\nThe\u00a0NHS offers a cervical screening programme\u00a0to all women from the age of\u00a025. During cervical screening (previously known as a \"smear test\"), a small sample of cells is taken from the cervix and checked under a microscope for abnormalities.\nAn abnormal cervical screening test doesn't mean you definitely have cancer. Most abnormal results are\u00a0caused by\u00a0an infection or the presence of treatable precancerous cells, rather than cancer itself.\nWomen aged 25 to 49 years of age are offered screening every three years, and women aged 50 to 64 are offered screening every five years.\u00a0For women who are 65 or older,\u00a0only those who haven't been screened since they were 50, or those who have had recent abnormal tests, are offered screening.\nYou should be sent a letter confirming when your screening appointment is due. Contact your GP if you think you may be overdue for a screening appointment.\nRead more about cervical screening\nWhat causes cervical cancer?\nAlmost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is a very common virus that can be passed on through any type of sexual contact with a man or a woman.\nThere are more than 100 different types of HPV, many of which are harmless. However, some types of HPV can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix, which can eventually lead to cervical cancer.\nTwo strains of the HPV virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18)\u00a0are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer.\u00a0These types of HPV infection don't have any symptoms, so many women won't realise they have the infection.\nHowever, it's important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who\u00a0have\u00a0them don't develop cervical cancer.\nUsing\u00a0condoms during sex offers some protection against HPV, but it can't always prevent infection, because the virus is also spread through skin-to-skin contact of the wider genital area.\nSince 2008, a\u00a0HPV vaccine\u00a0has been routinely offered to girls aged 12 and 13.\nRead more about the causes of cervical cancer\u00a0and preventing cervical cancer\nTreating cervical cancer\nIf cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it's usually possible to treat it using surgery. In some cases, it's possible to leave the womb in place, but it\u00a0may need to be removed. The surgical procedure used to remove the womb is\u00a0called a hysterectomy.\nRadiotherapy is an alternative to surgery for some women with early-stage cervical cancer. In some cases, it's used alongside surgery.\nMore advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nSome of the treatments used can have significant and long-lasting side effects, including early menopause\u00a0and infertility.\nRead more about treating cervical cancer\nComplications\nMany women with cervical cancer will have complications. These can arise as a direct result of the cancer or as a side effect of treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and\u00a0surgery.\nComplications associated with cervical cancer can range from the relatively minor, such as minor bleeding from the vagina or\u00a0having to urinate frequently, to life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or kidney failure.\nRead more about the complications of cervical cancer\nOutlook\nThe stage at which cervical cancer is diagnosed is an important factor in determining a woman's outlook. The staging, given as a number from one to four, indicates how far the cancer has spread.\nThe chances of living for at least five years after being diagnosed with cervical cancer are:\n\nstage 1 \u2013 80-99%\nstage 2 \u2013 60-90%\nstage 3 \u2013 30-50%\nstage 4 \u2013 20%\n\nRead more about the staging of cervical cancer\nIn the UK, just under 1,000 women die from cervical cancer every year.\nWho's affected by cervical cancer?\nFollowing the success of the NHS Cervical Screening Programme and the early detection of cell changes, the number of cervical cancer cases in the UK has reduced. Around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year.\nIt's possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, but the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. Cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25.\n"}, {"Name": "Chest Infection", "Information": "\nChest infections are common, especially after a cold or flu during autumn and winter.\nAlthough most are mild and get better on their own, some can be serious or even life-threatening.\nThis page covers:\nSigns and symptoms of a chest infection\nWhat causes chest infections?\nCaring for your symptoms at home\nWhen to see a doctor\nPreventing chest infections\nSigns and symptoms of a chest infection\nThe main symptoms of a chest infection can include:\n\na persistent cough\ncoughing up yellow or green phlegm (thick mucus), or coughing up blood\nbreathlessness or rapid and shallow breathing\nwheezing\na high temperature (fever)\na rapid heartbeat\nchest pain or tightness\nfeeling confused and disorientated\n\nYou may also experience more general symptoms of an infection, such as a headache, fatigue, sweating, loss of appetite, or joint and muscle pain.\nWhat causes chest infections?\nA chest infection is an infection of the lungs or airways. The main types of chest infection are bronchitis and pneumonia.\nMost bronchitis cases are caused by viruses, whereas most pneumonia cases are due to bacteria.\nThese infections are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This launches tiny droplets of fluid containing the virus or bacteria into the air, where they can be breathed in by others.\nThe infections can also be spread to others if you cough or sneeze onto your hand, an object or a surface, and someone else shakes your hand or touches those surfaces before touching their mouth or nose.\nCertain groups of people have a higher risk of developing serious chest infections, such as:\n\nbabies and very young children\nchildren with developmental problems\npeople who are very overweight\nelderly people\npregnant women\npeople who smoke\npeople with long-term health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\npeople with a weakened immune system \u2013 this could be due to a recent illness, a transplant, high-dose steroids, chemotherapy or a health condition, such as an undiagnosed HIV infection\n\nRead more about the causes of bronchitis and the causes of pneumonia\nCaring for your symptoms at home\nMany chest infections aren't serious and get better within a few days or weeks. You won't usually need to see your GP, unless your symptoms suggest you have a more serious infection (see below).\nWhile you recover at home, you can improve your symptoms by:\n\ngetting plenty of rest\ndrinking lots of fluid to prevent dehydration and to loosen the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up\ntreating headaches, fever and aches and pains with painkillers \u2013 such as paracetamol or ibuprofen\ndrinking a warm drink of honey and lemon \u2013 to relieve a sore throat caused by persistent coughing\nraising your head up with extra pillows while you're sleeping \u2013 to make breathing easier\nusing an air humidifier or inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water \u2013 to ease your cough (hot water shouldn't be used to treat young children with a cough, due to the risk of scalds)\nstopping smoking\n\nAvoid cough medicines, as there's little evidence they work, and coughing actually helps you clear the infection more quickly by getting rid of the phlegm from your lungs.\nAntibiotics aren't recommended for many chest infections, because they only work if the infection is caused by bacteria, rather than a virus.\nYour GP will usually only prescribe antibiotics if they think you have pneumonia, or you're at risk of complications such as fluid building up around the lungs (pleurisy).\nIf there's a flu outbreak in your local area and you're at risk of serious infection, your GP may also prescribe antiviral medication.\nRead more about treating bronchitis and treating pneumonia\nWhen to see a doctor\nYou should see your GP if:\n\nyou feel very unwell or your symptoms are severe\nyour symptoms are not improving\nyou feel confused, disorientated or drowsy\nyou have chest pain or difficulty breathing\nyou cough up blood or blood-stained phlegm\nyour skin or lips develop a blue tinge (cyanosis)\nyou're pregnant\nyou're 65 or over\nyou're very overweight and have difficulty breathing\nyou think a child under five has a chest infection\nyou have a weakened immune system\nyou have a long-term health condition\nyou have a cough that has lasted more than 3 weeks\n\nYour GP should be able to diagnose you based on your symptoms and by listening to your chest using a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs).\nIn some cases, further tests \u2013 such as a chest X-ray, breathing tests and testing phlegm or blood samples \u2013 may be necessary.\nPreventing chest infections\nThere are measures you can take to help reduce your risk of developing chest infections and stop them spreading to others.\nStop smoking\nIf you smoke, one of the best things you can do to prevent a chest infection is to stop. Smoking damages your lungs and weakens your defences against infection.\nRead more information and advice about stopping smoking\nGood hygiene\nAlthough chest infections generally aren't as contagious as other common infections, like flu, you can pass them on to others through coughing and sneezing.\nTherefore, it's important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and to wash your hands regularly. Put tissues in the bin immediately.\nAlcohol and diet\nExcessive and prolonged alcohol misuse can weaken your lungs' natural defences against infections and make you more vulnerable to chest infections.\nTo keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends:\n\nnot regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week\nif you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over three or more days\nif you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week\n\nRegular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis.\nEating a healthy, balanced diet can help strengthen the immune system, making you less vulnerable to developing chest infections.\nRead more about healthy eating and tips on cutting down on alcohol\nVaccinations\nIf you're at an increased risk of chest infections, your GP may recommend being vaccinated against flu and pneumococcal infections (a bacterium that can cause pneumonia).\nThese vaccinations should help to reduce your chances of getting chest infections in the future.\nFlu and pneumococcal vaccinations are usually recommended for:\n\nbabies and young children\npregnant women (flu jab only)\npeople aged 65 and over\npeople with long-term health conditions or weakened immune systems\n\n"}, {"Name": "Chest Pain", "Information": "\nChest pain can be caused by anything from muscle pain to a heart attack and should never be ignored.\nWhen to get help for chest pain\nYou should call 999 for an ambulance immediately\u00a0if you develop sudden severe chest pain, particularly if:\n\nthe pain feels heavy, pressing or tight\nthe pain\u00a0lasts longer than 15 minutes\nthe pain spreads to other parts of your body, such as\u00a0your arms, back or jaw\nyou also have other symptoms, such as\u00a0breathlessness,\u00a0nausea, sweating,\u00a0or coughing up blood\nyou are at risk of coronary heart disease\u00a0\u2013 for example, you smoke, are\u00a0obese, or have high blood pressure, diabetes\u00a0or high cholesterol\n\nIf the discomfort is only minor or has resolved, it may be more appropriate to either:\n\nspeak to your GP\ncall the 111 service\n\nCould it be a heart problem?\nChest pain isn't always caused by a problem with your heart, but it can sometimes be a symptom of:\n\nangina\u00a0\u2013 where the blood supply to the muscles of the heart is restricted\na\u00a0heart attack\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where the blood supply to part of the heart is suddenly blocked\n\nBoth of these conditions can cause a\u00a0dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest that can spread to the arms, neck, jaw or back.

A second dose can be taken after five minutes if the first dose is ineffective.\nIf there is no improvement five minutes after the second dose, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\nCommon causes of chest pain\nMost chest pain is not heart-related and isn't a sign of a life-threatening problem. Some common causes of chest pain are outlined below.\nThis information should give you an idea of whether these conditions may be causing your chest pain, but you should always seek medical advice to make sure you get a proper diagnosis.\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease\u00a0is a common condition where acid from the stomach comes up into the oesophagus (gullet).\nCommon symptoms of GORD include:\n\nburning chest pain (heartburn)\nan unpleasant taste in the mouth caused by stomach acid coming back up into your mouth\n\nThese symptoms usually occur soon after you've eaten and get worse if you bend over or lie down.\nGORD\u00a0can often be treated by making lifestyle changes and, if necessary, using medication. Read more about treating GORD.\nBone or muscle problems\nIf your chest is painful and tender to touch, it may be caused by a\u00a0strained muscle in your chest wall.\u00a0This can be surprisingly painful, but with rest the pain should ease and the muscle will heal\u00a0in time.\nIf you have pain, swelling and tenderness around your ribs, and the pain is made worse by lying down, breathing deeply,\u00a0coughing\u00a0or sneezing, you may have a condition called costochondritis.\nThis is caused by inflammation in the joints between the cartilage that joins the ribs to the breastbone (sternum).\u00a0The symptoms\u00a0often improve after a few weeks and may be relieved\u00a0by painkillers.\nAnxiety and panic attacks\nSome episodes of chest pain occur as part of an\u00a0anxiety or\u00a0panic attack.\nIn addition to chest pain and overwhelming feelings of anxiety, these attacks can cause symptoms such as\u00a0heart palpitations,\u00a0sweating, breathlessness and dizziness.\nMost panic attacks last for\u00a05 to 20 minutes. In the long-term, you may benefit from psychological therapy and\u00a0medication, or both.\u00a0\nLung conditions\nIf you have sharp chest pain that gets worse when you breathe in and out, and is accompanied by other symptoms such as a cough and breathlessness, it may be caused by a condition affecting the lungs or surrounding tissue, such as:\n\npneumonia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inflammation of the lungs, usually caused by an infection\npleurisy\u00a0\u2013 inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lungs, also usually caused by an infection\n\nMild cases of pneumonia can usually be treated with antibiotics, rest and fluids.\u00a0For people with other health conditions,\u00a0the condition\u00a0can be severe and they may need to be treated in hospital.\nTreatment for pleurisy will depend on the underlying cause. Pleurisy caused by a viral infection will often resolve without needing treatment, whereas pleurisy caused by a bacterial infection will usually need to be treated with antibiotics.\nAgain,\u00a0people who are frail or already in poor health may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.\nOther possible causes of chest pain\nThere are many other potential causes of chest pain, including:\n\nshingles\u00a0\u2013 a viral\u00a0infection of a nerve and the area of skin around it, which\u00a0causes\u00a0a painful rash that develops into itchy blisters\nmastitis\u00a0\u2013 pain and swelling of the breast, which is usually caused by an infection, most commonly during breastfeeding\nacute cholecystitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inflammation of the gallbladder, which can cause\u00a0a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy that spreads towards your right shoulder\nstomach ulcers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a break in the lining of the stomach, which can cause a burning or gnawing pain in your tummy\na pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blockage in the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs, which can cause\u00a0sharp, stabbing chest pain that may be worse when you breathe in, as well as breathlessness, a cough and dizziness\npericarditis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inflammation of the sac surrounding your heart, which can cause\u00a0a sudden, sharp and stabbing pain in your chest,\u00a0or more of a dull ache; the pain usually worsens when lying down\n\nSome of these conditions can be very serious.

However,\u00a0the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, remains inactive (dormant) in\u00a0your body's nerve tissues and can return\u00a0later in life as an illness called shingles.\nIt's possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around.\nRead more about shingles.\nIs there a vaccine against chickenpox?\nThere is a\u00a0chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. The vaccine is only offered to children\u00a0and adults who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox complications.\nThe recommended 2\u00a0doses of the vaccine is estimated to offer 98% protection from chickenpox in children and 75% protection in adolescents and adults.\nSo it may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination.

It most commonly affects the nervous and immune systems. Sometimes it is diagnosed as post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS).\nPeople with ME-CFS experience severe fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). This is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy, leading to a flare up in symptoms. This fatigue feels very different to ordinary tiredness and may take a day or two to kick in after physical, mental or emotional exertion.\nWho is affected?\nIt\u2019s estimated that about 20,000 people in Scotland have ME-CFS, while 250,000 in the UK, and around 17 million people worldwide are affected. It affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups.\nHow will ME-CFS affect my quality of life?\nNot everyone will experience the same symptoms so it\u2019s important not to compare people with ME-CFS. People with chronic fatigue syndrome can have very different experiences of the condition and how long their symptoms last. The impact of symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe. As symptoms change over time so does the impact they have on people\u2019s lives.\nHow long will it last?\nMost people with ME-CFS improve over time, although some people don't make a full recovery. It's also likely there will be periods when symptoms get better or worse. Children and young people with ME-CFS are more likely to recover fully.\nHow is chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosed?\nThere is no single test to detect chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis is made after other possible known causes for symptoms have been excluded. The earlier the illness is recognised, the sooner you can get help to manage your symptoms. Many people with ME-CFS find it helps to keep a diary of their symptoms so that they can take this to their GP or specialist.\nYour GP will usually:\n\nmake a physical and mental examination to rule out other conditions\nask about recent travel, tick/insect bites, unusual infections and drug/alcohol use\nreview current medication\narrange tests\n\nThey may be able to make a diagnosis after 3 or 4 months of seeing a pattern of symptoms. Anyone suspected of having chronic fatigue syndrome should be considered for a number of routine blood tests to identify other possible illnesses. More specialised investigation may be needed if the diagnosis remains in doubt.\nSome people with chronic fatigue syndrome also have another long term condition and it is important that you talk to your GP about how to manage the symptoms of the 2 conditions.\nHow chronic fatigue syndrome is treated\nTreatment will focus on managing and reducing symptoms related to ME-CFS. This means that treatment plans need to be tailored to the individual as people experience different symptoms and these symptoms may change over time. Your GP may be able to refer you to a specialist chronic fatigue syndrome service or to services that can support you to manage individual symptoms and manage restricted activity.\n"}, {"Name": "Chronic Kidney Disease", "Information": "\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively.\nCKD does not usually cause symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage.

Chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. Chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer. There are two main types:\n\nlymphocytes \u2013 mostly used to fight viral infections\nmyeloid cells \u2013 which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\n\nThese pages focus on chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is a cancer of the myeloid cells. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:\n\nchronic lymphocytic leukaemia\nacute myeloid leukaemia\nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia\n\nWhat happens in chronic leukaemia\nYour bone marrow produces stem cells. These are unique cells because they have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cell:\n\nred blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen around the body\nwhite blood cells \u2013 which help fight infection\nplatelets \u2013 which help stop bleeding\n\nIn leukaemia, a genetic mutation in the stem cells causes a huge over-production of white blood cells and a corresponding drop in red blood cells and platelets.\nIt's this lack of red blood cells which causes symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and the lack of platelets that increases the risk of excessive bleeding.\nWarning signs of chronic myeloid leukaemia\nIn its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms.

There is no evidence that it runs in families.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for chronic myeloid leukaemia depends to a large extent on how well a person responds to medication.\nMost patients (60-65%) do well on imatinib tablets, which are taken every day for life.\nFor those who\u00a0don't do well on imatinib, more than half respond to one of the alternative drugs. Nilotinib is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who are not responding to, or can't tolerate imatinib.\nThose who fail these drugs or cannot tolerate them may be offered a bone marrow transplant if this is a suitable treatment.\nRead more about the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia\nIf the condition is diagnosed early (the chronic phase), the outlook is excellent, with almost 90% of people living at least five years after diagnosis.\n"}, {"Name": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease", "Information": "\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease.\nPeople with COPD\u00a0have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction.\nTypical symptoms of COPD include:\n\nincreasing breathlessness when active\na persistent cough with phlegm\nfrequent chest infections\n\nRead more about the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nWhy does COPD happen?\nThe main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring.\nOver many years, the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. The walls of the airways thicken and more mucus is produced. Damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity.

The bacteria\u00a0often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control.\nHowever, some antibiotics can interfere with the balance of bacteria in\u00a0the bowel, which\u00a0can cause the C. difficile bacteria to multiply\u00a0and produce toxins that make the person ill.\nWhen this happens, C. difficile can spread easily to other people because the bacteria are passed out of the body in the person's diarrhoea.\nOnce out of the body, the bacteria turn into resistant cells called spores. These can survive for long periods on hands, surfaces (such as toilets), objects and clothing unless they're thoroughly cleaned, and can infect someone else if they get into their mouth.\nSomeone with a C. difficile infection is generally considered to be infectious until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up.\nHow to stop C. difficile spreading\nC.\u00a0difficile\u00a0infections can\u00a0be passed on\u00a0very easily.

This can weaken the heart, and increases the risk of developing heart failure, where the muscle is unable to efficiently pump blood around the body.\nIn addition, the blood pressure in the lungs is often too high. This is known as pulmonary hypertension and can damage the lungs and cause symptoms such as:\n\nbreathlessness\nfatigue\ndizziness\nfainting\n\nHow common is congenital heart disease?\nCongenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, with 1 in 180 babies being born with the condition.\nSome babies born with congenital heart disease will require immediate surgery after birth, while many others will probably require surgery or medication at some point during their childhood. \u00a0\nCongenital heart disease can sometimes develop alongside certain genetic conditions, such as Down\u2019s syndrome.\nAn infection during pregnancy, such as\u00a0rubella, can also cause congenital heart disease.\nHowever, many cases of congenital heart disease have no clear cause.\nOutlook for congenital heart disease\nThe outlook for congenital heart disease varies depending on the type and severity of the heart defect. \u00a0\u00a0\nResearch into the causes and improved treatments have meant that, 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood.\u00a0\nThis poses new challenges for healthcare services because some of these adults have complex health needs and require life-long specialised care. In response to this, the Department of Health has recommended the creation of specialised centres to care for adults with congenital heart disease.\u00a0\nCongenital heart disease in adults is sometimes known as \u2018grown-up congenital heart disease\u2019 (GUCH) or Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).\n"}, {"Name": "Conjunctivitis", "Information": "\nConjunctivitis is a common condition that causes redness and inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the front of the eye (the conjunctiva).\nPeople often refer to conjunctivitis as red eye.\nOther symptoms of conjunctivitis include itchiness and watering of the eyes, and sometimes a sticky coating on the eyelashes (if\u00a0it's caused by an\u00a0allergy).\nRead more about the symptoms of conjunctivitis\nConjunctivitis can affect one eye at first, but usually affects both eyes after a few hours.\nWhat causes conjunctivitis?\nThe conjunctiva can become inflamed as a result of:\n\na bacterial or viral infection \u2013 this is known as infective conjunctivitis\nan allergic reaction to a substance such as pollen or dust mites \u2013 this is known as allergic conjunctivitis\nthe eye coming into contact with things that can irritate the conjunctiva, such as\u00a0shampoo or chlorinated water, or a loose eyelash rubbing against the eye \u2013 this is known as irritant conjunctivitis\n\nRead more about the causes of conjunctivitis\nTreating conjunctivitis\nTreatment isn't usually needed for conjunctivitis, because the symptoms often clear up within a couple of weeks.

Home-based help will be needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home.\nThe average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that of Alzheimer's disease\u00a0\u2013 around five to eight years. However, as with Alzheimer's disease, this can be highly variable.\nIf you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you are not alone.

Aspirin\u00a0shouldn't be given to\u00a0children under 16.\nIf one painkiller doesn't relieve the pain, taking both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the doses shown in the medicine leaflet may help. This is safe for adults, but not for children under 16.\nIt may also help to:\n\navoid hot or cold food and drink if it makes the pain worse\ntry eating cool, soft foods if possible, using the opposite side of your mouth\nuse a soft toothbrush and temporarily avoid flossing around the affected tooth\n\nThese measures can help relieve your symptoms temporarily, but you shouldn't use them to delay getting help from a dentist.\nTreatments for a dental abscess\nDental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus.\nDepending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is, possible treatments include:\n\nremoving the affected tooth (extraction) \u2013 this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn't possible\nroot canal treatment \u2013 a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it\nincision and drainage \u2013 where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed)\n\nLocal anaesthetic will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under general anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're asleep).\nAntibiotics aren't routinely prescribed for dental abscesses, but may be used if the infection spreads or is particularly severe.\nWhat causes dental abscesses?\nYour mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque.\nIf you don't keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to\u00a0tooth decay or gum disease.\nThe following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess:\n\npoor oral hygiene \u2013 plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don't floss and brush your teeth regularly\nconsuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink \u2013 these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess\nan injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums \u2013 bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums\nhaving a weakened immune system \u2013 this includes people with certain underlying health conditions, such as\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0and\u00a0those having treatment, including\u00a0steroid medication\u00a0or chemotherapy\u00a0\n\nPreventing dental abscesses\nYou can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible.\nTo do this, you should:\n\nuse floss or an interdental brush at least once a day to clean between your teeth and under the gum line\nbrush your teeth with a\u00a0fluoride toothpaste twice a day \u2013\u00a0spending at least two minutes each time\navoid rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing because this washes the protective toothpaste away \u2013 just spit out any excess toothpaste\ncut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks \u2013\u00a0particularly between meals or shortly before going to bed\nvisit your dentist regularly \u2013 your dentist can suggest how often you should have a check-up, based on your oral health\u00a0\n\nRead more on\u00a0how to keep your teeth clean\u00a0and dental check-ups.\n"}, {"Name": "Depression", "Information": "\nEveryone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy.

This reaction causes a skin rash to develop.\nDiagnosing dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)\nA diagnosis of DH is confirmed by a skin test called a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure where a sample of skin is removed to be tested.\nWhat is involved in a skin biopsy?\nDuring this test, a specialist skin doctor called a dermatologist will take a small sample of skin from an area without the rash. Samples of skin taken from the area with the rash don't always give an accurate result.\nThe skin sample is then tested. If you test positive for DH you'll be referred to a specialist gut doctor called a gastroenterologist to be tested for coeliac disease.\nDiet before and during diagnosis\nTo ensure an accurate skin test is taken first time, it's important to keep eating gluten-containing foods before and during diagnosis.\nIf you've already removed gluten from your diet, you must reintroduce it in more than one meal every day for at least 6 weeks before having the tests.\nTreating dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)\nThe treatment for DH is a lifelong gluten-free diet.\nGluten-free diet\nA gluten-free diet is when all gluten-containing foods are removed from your diet\nGluten is found in wheat, barley and rye and sometimes people are sensitive to oats too.\nA gluten-free diet should only start once a confirmed diagnosis of DH is given.\nFind out how to live with a gluten-free diet\nHow long does treatment take to work?\nThe length of time it takes for the skin to heal varies from person to person but it can take up to 2 years or more.\nMedication during treatment\nSome patients will be given medication to help them over this period of recovery.\nMedication will only be given to control the skin itching and blisters and doesn't treat any other symptoms.\nThe drug most likely to be used is called Dapsone.\nDapsone\nDapsone is taken in tablet form and must be swallowed.\nIt helps ease the itching and controls the development of blisters. It should work within a few days.\nIf you stop taking Dapsone before the gluten-free diet has taken effect, the rash will return.\nSide effects of Dapsone\nThe most common side effect of Dapsone is anaemia.\nLess common side effects are headaches and depression, while nerve damage is rare.\nBecause of these side effects, you'll always be prescribed the lowest effective dose. DH should be monitored once the drug dose has been reduced.\nMore information about this medicine is available in the Dapsone patient information leaflet.\nAlternatives to Dapsone\nSome people can't tolerate Dapsone. If you're one of these people, the following drugs can also be taken to clear the rash:\n\nSulphapyridine\nSulphamethoxypyridazine\n\nComplications of\u00a0dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)\nThe same associated conditions and complications can occur in people with DH as in people with coeliac disease.\nSome potential complications of DH include:\n\nosteoporosis\ncertain kinds of gut cancer\nan increased risk of other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and thyroid disease\n\nAs with coeliac disease, the risk of developing these is reduced by following a gluten-free diet.\nMore about dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)\nThe British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) have produced a patient leaflet - Dermatitis Herpetiformis (gluten sensitivity) - which gives more information about this condition.\n"}, {"Name": "Diarrhoea", "Information": "\nDiarrhoea is passing looser or more frequent stools than is normal for you.\nIt affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about.

The type of dysphagia you have can usually be diagnosed after testing your swallowing ability and examining your oesophagus.\nMany cases of dysphagia can be improved with treatment, but a cure isn't always possible. Treatments for dysphagia include:\n\nspeech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques\u00a0\nchanging the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow\nalternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach\nsurgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent)\n\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing dysphagia and treating dysphagia.\nComplications of dysphagia\nDysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. One of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food\u00a0goes down the \"wrong way\" and blocks your airway.\nIf this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking\u00a0because you fear\u00a0choking, which\u00a0can lead to malnutrition and dehydration.\nSome people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspiration pneumonia, which require medical treatment.\nDysphagia can also affect your quality of life\u00a0as it may prevent\u00a0you enjoying meals and social occasions.\nRead more about the\u00a0complications of dysphagia.\n"}, {"Name": "Dystonia", "Information": "\nDystonia is a medical term for a range of movement disorders that cause muscle spasms and contractions.\nThe spasms and contractions may either be sustained or may come and go.\nMovements\u00a0are\u00a0often\u00a0repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures.\u00a0Tremor (shaking) can also be a characteristic of some types of dystonia.\nDystonia is thought to be a neurological condition (caused by underlying problems with the brain and nervous system). However,\u00a0in most cases, brain functions such as intelligence, memory and language remain unaffected.\nTypes of dystonia\nDystonia can affect only one muscle or a group of muscles. There are five main types of dystonia:\n\nFocal dystonia \u2013 where a single region, such as the hand or eyes,\u00a0is affected. Cervical dystonia, blepharospasm (abnormal twitch of the eyelid), laryngeal dystonia and writer's cramp are all examples of focal dystonia.\u00a0If it only affects someone during specific activities, such as writing, it's described as task-specific dystonia.\nSegmental dystonia \u2013 where two or more connected regions of the body are affected. Cranial dystonia (blepharospasm affecting the lower face and\u00a0jaw or tongue) is an example.\u00a0\nMultifocal dystonia \u2013 where two or more regions of the body that aren't connected to each other, such as the left arm and left leg, are affected.\u00a0\nGeneralised dystonia \u2013 where the trunk and at least two other parts of the body are affected. The legs may or may not be affected.\u00a0\nHemidystonia \u2013 where one entire side of the body is affected.\u00a0\n\nAbout 90% of all cases are either cervical dystonia (which affects the neck muscles) or blepharospasm (which affects the eyelids). These are both focal dystonias that tend to develop later in life. They don\u2019t usually get any worse and no other muscles are affected.\nRead more about the symptoms of dystonia.\nCauses of dystonia\nExactly how dystonia develops remains uncertain, but it's thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain that controls muscle movement (the basal ganglia).\nIf there's no identifiable cause of dystonia, or if the cause is genetic, it's described as primary dystonia.\nSecondary dystonia is where dystonia\u00a0occurs as a symptom of an underlying condition or injury. Common causes include stroke, brain injury, encephalitis\u00a0and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nRead more about the causes of dystonia.\nDiagnosing dystonia\nDystonia is diagnosed by a specialist examining and recognising the typical symptoms. The type of dystonia is then classified by which area of the body is affected.\nWhen diagnosing dystonia, it's important to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia, because this may determine the type of treatment you need.\nIf you have typical signs of late-onset focal dystonia, specific investigations may not be required. However, tests may be needed to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia. These may include brain scans, urine or\u00a0blood tests, and genetic testing.\nRead more about how dystonia is diagnosed.\nTreating dystonia\nThere's no cure for dystonia, but\u00a0the condition can usually be effectively managed.\u00a0\nTreatment will vary, depending on the type of dystonia you have and the precise nature of your symptoms. However, the four main types of treatment are:\n\nbotulinum toxin \u2013 widely used to treat neurological conditions that involve abnormal muscle contractions, such as dystonia; it's injected into the affected muscles to temporarily weaken them and reduce spasms\nmedication \u2013 such as anticholinergics, Baclofen and muscle relaxants\nphysiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 where exercises are used to improve range of motion and\u00a0posture, and prevent muscle weakness\nsurgery \u2013 if other treatments are unsuccessful, the nerves controlling\u00a0the muscles\u00a0causing spasms can be cut (selective peripheral denervation), or electrodes can be implanted within the brain, which are connected to a small device that's similar to a pacemaker (deep brain stimulation)\n\nRead more about how dystonia is treated.\nOutlook\nDystonia is an unpredictable condition. It tends to progress slowly and the severity of a person's symptoms can vary from one day to another.\nFocal dystonia usually progresses gradually over a period of about\u00a0five years and then doesn't get any worse.\nSometimes, a person's symptoms improve or disappear completely.\u00a0This is known as total\u00a0remission and it's thought to occur in around 5-10% of people.\nTotal remission is more likely in cases of secondary dystonia, such as dystonia that occurs after a stroke. If someone has another underlying condition, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, the\u00a0symptoms of dystonia are more likely to last for the rest of their lives.\nWho\u00a0is affected by\u00a0dystonia?\nDystonia is generally uncommon, although\u00a0it's one of the more common neurological conditions.\nDystonia can\u00a0affect men, women and children. It can be difficult to diagnose, and there may be many people with the\u00a0condition who remain undiagnosed.\nThe Dystonia Society\u00a0estimates that at least 70,000 people are affected by dystonia in the UK. At least 8,000 of these\u00a0are children and young people.\n"}, {"Name": "Earache", "Information": "\nEarache is a common problem, particularly in children.

It usually passes out of the ears harmlessly, but sometimes too much can build up and block the ears.\nA build-up of earwax is a common problem that can often be treated using eardrops bought from a pharmacy.\nIf pharmacy treatment doesn't work, contact your GP surgery. They may suggest having your ears washed out.\nIf these treatments don't help, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) department for specialised treatment.\nWhat can cause an earwax build-up?\nSome people regularly get blocked ears because they naturally produce a lot of earwax.\nOther factors that can increase the risk of too much earwax include:\n\nproducing naturally hard or dry earwax\nhaving narrow or hairy ear canals (the tube between the opening of the ear and the eardrum)\nbeing elderly, as earwax becomes drier with age\nbony growths in the outer part of the ear canal\n\nEarwax can also block your ear if you frequently insert objects into your ear canal, such as cotton buds, ear plugs or\u00a0hearing aids.\nSymptoms of an earwax build-up\nA build-up of earwax in your ear can cause:\n\nearache\nhearing loss\ntinnitus (hearing sounds from inside your body)\nitchiness in or around the ear\nvertigo (a spinning sensation)\near infections\n\nThese\u00a0problems will usually improve once the excess earwax has been removed.\nWhat to do if you think your ear is blocked\nNever try to remove a build-up of earwax yourself with your fingers, a cotton bud or any other object. This can damage your ear and push the wax further down.\nIf the earwax is only causing minor problems, you can try buying some eardrops from a pharmacy.\u00a0Using drops may make your hearing or symptoms a little worse at first before getting better. These can help soften the earwax so that it falls out naturally.\nThere are several different types of eardrops you can use, including drops containing sodium bicarbonate, olive oil or almond oil.\nHowever, eardrops aren't suitable for everyone and\u00a0some can\u00a0irritate the skin. For example, eardrops shouldn't be used\u00a0if you have a perforated eardrum\u00a0(a hole or tear in\u00a0your eardrum).\nSpeak to your pharmacist about the most suitable product for you and make sure you read the leaflet that comes with it.\nWhen to see your GP\nContact your GP surgery if you have particularly troublesome symptoms or eardrops haven't helped after three to five days.\nYour GP or practice nurse will look inside your ears to check if they're blocked and might carry out some simple hearing tests.\nThey may suggest using eardrops for a bit longer, or they may carry out a minor procedure called ear irrigation to clean out your ear canal.\nIf these treatments aren't suitable or don't help, your GP may refer you to the ENT department of your nearest hospital for more specialised treatments such as microsuction or an aural toilet.\nTreatments to remove earwax\nThere are several different earwax removal treatments available.\nThe main treatments are:\n\neardrops \u2013 drops\u00a0used several times a day for a few days to soften the earwax so that it falls out by itself\near irrigation \u2013 a quick and painless procedure where an electric pump is used to push water into your ear and wash the earwax out\nmicrosuction \u2013 a quick and painless procedure where a small device is used to suck the earwax out of your ear\naural toilet \u2013 where a thin instrument with a small\u00a0hoop at one end is used to clean your ear and scrape out the earwax\n\nNot all these treatments are suitable for everyone.

This type of Ewing sarcoma is known as extraosseous, which means outside the bone.\nSymptoms of Ewing sarcoma\nThe symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body.\nThe main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness.\nOther possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss.\nIn some cases of Ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. However, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture.\nWhat causes Ewing sarcoma?\nLike\u00a0other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is\u00a0unknown.\nAs the\u00a0condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is\u00a0that it may be related to fast-growing bones.\nThe rapid growth spurt that\u00a0happens during puberty\u00a0may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer.\nResearch has also found babies born with an\u00a0umbilical hernia are three times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma.\u00a0\nHowever, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of bone cancer.\nDiagnosing Ewing sarcoma\nWhen\u00a0you visit your GP because of bone pain, they'll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area.\nYour GP may refer you for\u00a0an X-ray to check for anything abnormal. If\u00a0abnormalities are found, you'll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist).\nThey may recommend that you\u00a0have a\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0to examine the area in closer detail.\nA bone biopsy\u00a0may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle\u00a0is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a\u00a0general anaesthetic or a\u00a0local anaesthetic.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for bone cancer\u00a0and the stages of bone cancer.\nTreating Ewing sarcoma\nLike all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.\nEwing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy,\u00a0surgery and radiotherapy.\nChemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove.\nEwing sarcoma also responds well to radiotherapy. It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning.\nIn some cases, surgically removing Ewing's sarcoma can be difficult\u00a0\u2013 for example, if it develops in the pelvis. In this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment.\nSurgery\nIf surgery is recommended, the type you'll have will depend on:\n\nthe size of the tumour\nwhere it is in your body\nwhether it has\u00a0grown into the tissues surrounding the bone\n\nYou may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection.\nLimb-sparing surgery\u00a0involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg\u00a0where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed.\nIn some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed (amputation).\u00a0This may be the only option\u00a0to prevent the cancer returning if it's spread into the tissues surrounding the bone.\nFor more information about the types of treatment for bone cancer, visit the Cancer Research UK website.\nLiving with bone cancer\nIf you're diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and\u00a0frightening.\u00a0Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you\u00a0make decisions.\nThe majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure.\nHowever, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and bereavement.\nIt's important to seek help and talk about how you're feeling. You could talk to\u00a0your partner, family, friends or the healthcare professionals in charge of your care. Talking to others will help you come to terms with your condition and treatment.\nThere are\u00a0also a number of practical issues you'll need to deal with, such as financial matters\u00a0and coping with day-to-day activities\u00a0such as school, college or work.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about your emotions and cancer\u00a0and coping with bone cancer.\nInformation about you\nIf you or your child has\u00a0Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register\n"}, {"Name": "Ewing Sarcoma Children", "Information": "\nEwing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer in children and young people. This information describes Ewing sarcoma, its symptoms, diagnosis and possible treatments.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are now new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nSarcomas\nSarcomas are rare types of cancer that develop in the supporting tissues of the body. There are two main types: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas.\nBone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton, but may also develop in the soft tissue near bones.\nSoft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body.\nEwing sarcoma\nEwing sarcoma is the second most common primary sarcoma in children and young people. This type of cancer is a bone cancer and most commonly occurs in the long bones, ribs, pelvis and spine (vertebral column).\nFewer than 30 children in the UK develop Ewing sarcoma each year. It usually occurs in the teenage years, and is more common in boys.\nAlthough Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer, it can also occur very rarely in the soft tissues. This is called extraosseous Ewing sarcoma. Another type of Ewing sarcoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). These can be found in either the bone or soft tissue.\nCauses\nThe exact causes of primary bone cancer are unknown. The development of Ewing sarcoma may be related in some way to times of rapid bone growth, which may explain why more cases are seen in teenagers. Like other cancers, it\u2019s not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.\nSigns and symptoms\nPain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. It is frequently worse at night. However, symptoms may vary depending on the position and size of the cancer. There may be some swelling in the affected area if the tumour is close to the surface of the body and it may become tender to touch. This may cause a limp if in the leg or pelvis. Bone cancer is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the child has a minor fall or accident. Occasionally, there may be fever or weight loss.\nHow Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed\nUsually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or x rays. If a sarcoma is suspected, your GP should refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre. A variety of tests and investigations are needed to diagnose Ewing sarcoma, including an x-ray of the painful part of the bone, a chest x-ray and a blood test. A specialist doctor will remove a small piece of the tumour to look at under a microscope (biopsy). Other tests may be done, such as a bone scan, PET scan, a bone marrow biopsy; an MRI or CT scan may also be done.\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nTreatment\nA combination of various treatments is used to treat Ewing sarcoma. These include chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the size and position of the tumour.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.\nThis is a very important component of treatment for the majority of children with Ewing sarcoma and can help make surgery more straightforward. A combination of different chemotherapy drugs are given before surgery and continued afterwards in order to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the sarcoma from spreading. Chemotherapy given in this way is called adjuvant chemotherapy.\nSurgery\nIf surgery is needed, it should be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic bone tumour centre. The aim of surgery is to remove the tumour without causing too much damage. If the tumour is in one of the main bones of the arm or leg, however, it may be necessary to remove the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone. If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery.\nAmputation\nSometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer has affected the surrounding blood vessels and nerves. After amputation, a false limb will be fitted, and this will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sport.\nLimb-sparing surgery\nThere are several ways in which limb-sparing surgery may be done. It may involve:\n\nreplacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part)\nreplacing the bone with bone taken from another part of the body (a bone graft)\n\nAfter limb-sparing surgery, the child is often able to use the limb almost normally. However, it is best not to take part in any contact sports, because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it. If the child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened from time to time as the bone grows. This may mean further short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened during an outpatient procedure.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. Ewing sarcoma responds very well to radiotherapy. It is often used after chemotherapy and before or after surgery. If the tumour is impossible to remove surgically, it is a good option.\nSide effects of treatment for Ewing sarcoma\nTreatment often causes side effects. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the actual treatment being used and the part of the body that\u2019s being treated.\nSide effects can include:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\nhair loss\nincreased risk of infection\nbruising and bleeding\ntiredness\ndiarrhoea\n\nRadiotherapy can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness. If your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having.\nLate side effects\nA small number of children may develop other side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in normal bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer later in life. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will explain all of this to you and will monitor your child carefully for any potential late side effects.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancers. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nYour child will have regular follow-up appointments, with x-rays or scans as necessary. Many children with Ewing sarcoma can be cured. Even if the tumour comes back, further treatment may be given successfully. Your child will be checked up on every few months for the first three years after treatment and then every six months for another two years.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor who knows the situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Eye Cancer", "Information": "\nBetween 500 and 600 cases of eye cancer (ocular cancer) are diagnosed in the UK each year.\nThere are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including:\n\neye melanoma\nsquamous cell carcinoma\nlymphoma\nretinoblastoma \u2013 a childhood cancer\n\nCancer can also sometimes develop in the tissues surrounding your eyeball or spread to the eye from other\u00a0parts of the body, such as the lungs or breasts.\nThis topic focuses on melanoma of the eye, one of the most common types of eye cancer.\u00a0The Cancer Research UK website has\u00a0more information about other types of eye cancer.\nThis page covers:\nSymptoms of eye cancer\nAbout melanoma of the eye\nWhat causes eye melanoma?\nDiagnosing melanoma of the eye\nTreatments for eye melanoma\nOutlook for eye melanoma\nSymptoms of eye cancer\nEye cancer doesn't always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test.\nSymptoms of eye cancer can include:\n\nshadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision\nblurred vision\na dark patch in your\u00a0eye that's getting bigger\npartial or total loss of vision\nbulging of one eye\na lump on your eyelid or in\u00a0your eye that's increasing in size\npain in or around your eye, although this is rare\n\nThese symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they're not necessarily a sign of cancer. However, it's important to get the symptoms\u00a0checked by a doctor as soon as possible.\nMelanoma of the eye\nMelanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most\u00a0melanomas develop in the skin, but it's also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye.\nEye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it\u00a0uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected.\nIt\u00a0can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin\u00a0layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid.\nWhat causes eye melanoma?\nEye melanoma occurs when\u00a0the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nIt's not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening:\n\nlighter eye colour \u2013 if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared\u00a0with people who have brown eyes\nwhite or pale skin \u2013 eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in\u00a0those with fair skin\nunusual moles \u2013 if you have\u00a0irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you're more at risk of developing skin cancer and eye melanoma\nuse of sunbeds \u2013\u00a0there's some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma\noverexposure to sunlight \u2013 this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma\n\nThe risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their 50s.\nRead about the risk factors for other types of eye cancer\u00a0on the Cancer Research UK website.\nDiagnosing melanoma of the eye\nIf your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects\u00a0you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist\u00a0for an assessment.\nIf they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they'll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are four centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Glasgow.\nIt's likely you'll have a number of different tests at the centre, including:\n\nan eye examination \u2013\u00a0to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities\nan ultrasound scan of your eye \u2013\u00a0a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows\u00a0your doctor to\u00a0find\u00a0out more about the position of the tumour and its size\na\u00a0fluorescein angiogram \u2013 where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour\n\nOccasionally,\u00a0a thin needle\u00a0may be\u00a0used to remove a small sample\u00a0of cells from\u00a0the\u00a0tumour (biopsy).\u00a0The genetic information in these cells is analysed to\u00a0give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back.\nTreatments for\u00a0eye melanoma\nTreatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications.\nTreatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible.\nThe main treatments for eye melanoma are:\n\nbrachytherapy \u2013\u00a0tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near\u00a0the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells\nexternal radiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells\nsurgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye \u2013 this may be possible if\u00a0the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye\nremoval of the eye (enucleation) \u2013 this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you've lost your vision;\u00a0the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches\u00a0your other eye\n\nChemotherapy is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the treatment options for eye cancer and the types of eye cancer surgery.\nOutlook for eye melanoma\nThe outlook for melanoma of the eye depends on how\u00a0big the cancer is at the time it's diagnosed and exactly which parts of the eye are affected.\nOverall:\n\nabout 8 out of every 10 people (80%) diagnosed with a small eye melanoma will live for at least five years after diagnosis\nabout 7 out of every 10 people (70%) diagnosed with a medium-sized eye melanoma will live for at least five years after diagnosis\nabout\u00a05\u00a0out of\u00a0every 10 people (50%) diagnosed with a large eye melanoma will live for at least five years after diagnosis\n\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the stages of\u00a0eye cancer\u00a0and\u00a0statistics and outlook for eye cancer.\n"}, {"Name": "Febrile Seizures", "Information": "\nA febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever.\nFebrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren't serious.\nAround one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur\u00a0between the ages of six months and three years.\nDuring a febrile seizure, the child's body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure.\nRead more about the symptoms of febrile seizures\nWhat to do during a seizure\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side.

It's a fit that:\n\nis a tonic clonic seizure (see above)\nlasts less than 15 minutes\ndoesn't reoccur within 24 hours or the period in which your child has an illness\n\nComplex febrile seizure\nComplex febrile seizures are less common, accounting for two out of 10 cases. A complex febrile seizure is any seizure that has one or more of the following features:\n\nthe seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes\nyour child only has symptoms in one part of their body (this is known as a partial or focal seizure)\nyour child has another seizure within 24 hours of the first seizure, or during the same period\u00a0of illness\nyour child doesn't fully recover from the seizure within one hour\n\nWhy febrile seizures occur\nThe cause of febrile seizures is unknown, although they're linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above).\nIn most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as:\n\nchickenpox\nflu (influenza)\nmiddle ear infections (otitis media) \ntonsillitis\n\nThere may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures because the chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them. Around one in four children affected by febrile seizures has a family history of the condition.\nRead more about the causes of febrile seizures\nComplications\nFebrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk of epilepsy, as well as other problems.\nRecent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy.\nHowever, this link hasn't been proven and SUDC is incredibly rare, affecting around one in 100,000 children which is equivalent to a 0.001% chance.\nIn addition, one of the biggest studies of its kind looked at more than 1.5 million children with a history of febrile seizures and found no evidence of an increased risk of death in later childhood or adulthood.\nFebrile seizures and epilepsy\nMany parents worry that if their child has one or more febrile seizures, they'll develop epilepsy when they get older. Epilepsy is a condition where a person has repeated seizures without fever.\nWhile it's true that children who have a history of febrile seizures have an increased risk of developing epilepsy, it should be stressed that the risk is still small.\nIt's estimated that children with a history of simple febrile seizures have a one in 50 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. Children with a history of complex febrile seizures have a one in 20 chance of developing epilepsy in later life.\nThis is compared to around a one in 100 chance for people who haven't had febrile seizures.\n"}, {"Name": "Fever In Children", "Information": "\nA fever is a high temperature.

Women who do have\u00a0symptoms (around one in three) may experience:\n\nheavy periods or painful periods\ntummy (abdominal) pain\nlower\u00a0back pain\na frequent need to urinate\nconstipation\npain or discomfort during sex\n\nIn rare cases, further\u00a0complications caused by fibroids\u00a0can affect pregnancy or cause infertility.\nSeeing your GP\nAs fibroids don't often cause symptoms, they're sometimes diagnosed by chance during a routine gynaecological examination, test or scan.\nHowever, see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of fibroids so they can investigate possible causes.\nIf your GP thinks you may have fibroids, they'll usually refer you for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis.\nRead more about diagnosing fibroids\nWhy fibroids\u00a0develop\nThe exact cause of fibroids is unknown. However,\u00a0they're linked to the hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen is the female reproductive hormone produced by the ovaries (the female reproductive organs).\nFibroids usually develop during a woman's reproductive years (from around 16 to 50 years of age) when oestrogen levels are at their highest. They tend to shrink when oestrogen levels are low, such as after the menopause (when a woman's monthly periods\u00a0stop).\nWho gets fibroids?\nFibroids are common, with around 1 in 3 women developing them at some\u00a0point in their life. They most often occur in women aged 30-50.\nFibroids\u00a0are thought to develop\u00a0more frequently\u00a0in\u00a0women of African- Caribbean origin. It's also thought they occur more often\u00a0in overweight or\u00a0obese women because\u00a0being overweight increases the level of oestrogen in the body.\nWomen who've had children have a lower risk of developing fibroids, and the risk decreases further the more children you have.\nTypes of fibroids\nFibroids can grow anywhere in the womb and vary in size considerably. Some\u00a0can be\u00a0the size of a pea, whereas others can be the size of a melon.\nThe main types of fibroids are:\n\nintramural fibroids \u2013 the most common type of fibroid, which develop in the muscle wall of the womb\nsubserosal fibroids \u2013 fibroids that\u00a0develop outside the wall of the womb into the pelvis and can become very large\nsubmucosal fibroids \u2013 fibroids that develop in the muscle layer beneath the womb's inner lining and grow into the cavity of the womb\n\nIn some cases, subserosal or submucosal fibroids\u00a0are attached to the womb with\u00a0a narrow stalk of tissue. These are known as pedunculated fibroids.\nTreating fibroids\nTreatment for fibroids isn't needed if they aren't causing symptoms.

It's more commonly known as \"passing wind\", or \"farting\".\nFarting is often laughed about, but excessive flatulence can be embarrassing and make you feel uncomfortable around others. However, it can usually be controlled with\u00a0changes to your diet and lifestyle.\nFlatulence is\u00a0a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about\u00a05 to 15 times a day.\nWhy\u00a0it happens\nWhen you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by\u00a0farting (flatulence) or\u00a0burping (belching).\nSometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur. However, it's important to remember it's normal for the gas you pass to sometimes smell a bit.\nExcessive\u00a0flatulence can be caused by swallowing more air than usual or\u00a0eating food that's difficult to digest. It can also be\u00a0related to\u00a0an underlying health problem affecting the digestive system, such as recurring indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nRead more about the causes of flatulence.\nWhen to see your GP\nThere are no medical guidelines defining the normal frequency or volume of flatulence. You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms.\nSee your GP if your flatulence is particularly troublesome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if you're frequently passing smelly gas.\nYou should also visit your GP if you experience additional symptoms, such as:\n\npersistent\u00a0abdominal pain and bloating\nrecurring episodes of\u00a0diarrhoea or\u00a0constipation\nunexplained weight loss\nbowel incontinence\u00a0\nblood in your stools\u00a0(faeces)\nsigns of an infection,\u00a0such as a high temperature, vomiting, chills,\u00a0joint pain and muscle pain\n\nThese symptoms could be an indicator of a more serious health problem and may\u00a0require investigation, such as a blood or stool test to look for an infection.\nControlling the problem\nExcessive\u00a0flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as:\n\navoiding foods known to cause flatulence\neating smaller and more frequent meals\neating and drinking slowly\nexercising regularly\n\nThere are also some over-the-counter medications that can help if your flatulence is troublesome, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone.\nIf your flatulence is related to an underlying health problem, treating the condition may help\u00a0resolve it.\nRead more about treating flatulence.\n"}, {"Name": "Flu", "Information": "\nFlu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes.

Around 800 people in the UK are diagnosed with the condition each year.\nThere are a number of different types of gallbladder cancer,\u00a0depending on the cells affected.\nOver 85% of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinoma, which means the\u00a0cancer\u00a0started in the gland cells lining the gallbladder.\nCancer that starts in the skin-like cells that line the gallbladder is known as squamous cell cancer.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the different types of gallbladder cancer.\nCancer of the gallbladder is more common in women than men, with around 7 out of 10 cases diagnosed in women. It's also more common in older people, particularly those over 70 years of age.\nThe gallbladder\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that's located underneath the liver. It's main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.\nBile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it's stored.\nOver time, bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed.\nThe gallbladder is a useful but not essential organ, which can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.\nSymptoms of gallbladder cancer\nIn the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn't cause symptoms, which\u00a0means it could be at an advanced stage by the time it's diagnosed.\nSymptoms that occur at a later stage can include:\n\nabdominal (stomach) pain\nfeeling sick\njaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\n\nThese symptoms could be linked to\u00a0a number of conditions and may not be related to gallbladder cancer. However,\u00a0if you have these symptoms, you should\u00a0visit your GP so they can investigate what's causing them.\nOther possible symptoms of gallbladder cancer can include loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss\u00a0and a swollen stomach.\nWhat causes gallbladder cancer?\nIn gallbladder cancer, abnormal cells grow within the gallbladder. It's not known why this happens, but certain things are thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.\nGallbladder cancer is more common in older people, and your chances of developing it increase with age. In the UK, most cases occur in people over the age of 70.\nLifestyle factors \u2013 such as obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet \u2013 are believed to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. However, there's not enough evidence to show a firm link between diet and gallbladder cancer.\nThere are also a number of conditions that can increase your chances of developing gallbladder cancer. For example, gallstones, cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and diabetes\u00a0have been closely linked to the condition.\nIf you have a family history of gallstones, cholecystitis, or gallbladder cancer, you're more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of gallbladder cancer.\nDiagnosing gallbladder cancer\nYour GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. If they suspect gallbladder cancer, they may refer you to a specialist, usually a gastroenterologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions of the digestive system).\nThe\u00a0specialist will ask about your medical history and check to see whether the lymph glands in your neck and groin are swollen.\nYou may also have some initial tests, including:\n\nblood tests\nan ultrasound scan\na\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan\n\nIf these tests reveal anything abnormal in or around your gallbladder, further tests may be arranged\u00a0to help\u00a0confirm whether you have gallbladder cancer. These may\u00a0include:\n\nan endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\na magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\nbiopsy\u00a0and fine needle aspiration (FNA)\n\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for gallbladder cancer.\nTreating gallbladder cancer\nThe main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.\nChemotherapy and radiotherapy are also sometimes used, either on their own or in combination with surgery.\nThe treatment programme that's most suitable for you will depend on:\n\nthe type of gallbladder cancer you have\nthe stage of your cancer\nyour overall level of health\n\nAs with all cancers, the chances of survival depend on how far the condition has advanced when it is diagnosed.\nFor example, if the cancerous cells\u00a0are confined to the gallbladder lining, your\u00a0chances of living for more than five years are good (about 80%).\nHowever, if gallbladder cancer has spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes, your chances of living for at least five years are much lower (30%).\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about treating\u00a0gallbladder cancer and the stages and outlook for gallbladder cancer.\u00a0\n"}, {"Name": "Gallstones", "Information": "\nGallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder.

Some people are also concerned about the cysts appearance.\nMost symptoms settle with time.\nHow they're diagnosed\nTo diagnose a ganglion cyst, a healthcare professional will ask you about it and examine your wrist and hand.\nGiving a diagnosis is usually straightforward. However, scans may be helpful if the diagnosis is uncertain.\nTreating a ganglion cyst\nAbout 50% of ganglions disappear on their own without treatment. In the early stages you should wait to see if this happens.\nYou won't need treatment unless the cyst is painful.\nMedication\nMany people take medication to cope with their pain and symptoms, and help them remain active.\nYou may be prescribed pain medication to ease the pain. Make sure you take any medication as prescribed, and get advice from a GP, pharmacist or suitably trained healthcare professional.\nSurgery\nIf the ganglion hasn't reduced in size after 6 months or is causing significant functional difficulty and/or pain, you may be referred for further help and possible surgery.\nSurgery is considered if it causes significant pain or restricts movement in your joint.

Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds.\nMake sure they get plenty of rest.\nLet your child eat if they're eating solids and feel hungry. Try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread.\nGive them\u00a0paracetamol if they have an uncomfortable\u00a0fever or aches and pains. Young children may find liquid paracetamol easier to swallow than tablets.\nUse special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if they're dehydrated. Your GP or pharmacist can advise on how much to give your child. Don't give them antidiarrhoeal and anti-vomiting medication, unless advised to by your GP or pharmacist.\n\nMake sure you and your child wash your hands regularly while your child is ill and keep them\u00a0away from school or nursery until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared (see Preventing gastroenteritis).\nGetting medical advice for your child\nYou don't\u00a0usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP surgery can put others at risk.\nPhone the 111 service or your GP if you're concerned about your child, or they:\n\nhave\u00a0symptoms of dehydration, such as passing less urine than normal, being unusually irritable or unresponsive, pale or mottled skin, or cold hands and feet\nhave blood in their poo or green vomit\nare vomiting constantly and are\u00a0unable to keep down any fluids or feeds\nhave had diarrhoea for more than a week\nhave been vomiting for three days or more\nhave signs of a more serious illness, such as a high fever (over 38C or 100.4F), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, a stiff neck, a rash that doesn't fade when you roll a glass over it or a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby's head)\nhave a serious underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting\n\nYour GP may suggest sending off a sample of your child's poo to a laboratory to confirm what's causing their symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows they have a bacterial infection.\nHow gastroenteritis is spread\nThe bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person.\nYou can catch\u00a0the infection\u00a0if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through:\n\nclose contact with someone with\u00a0gastroenteritis \u2013 they may breathe out small particles of vomit\ntouching contaminated surfaces or objects\neating contaminated food \u2013\u00a0this can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food, or you eat food that has been in contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or hasn't been stored and cooked at the correct temperatures (read more about the causes of food poisoning)\n\nA person with\u00a0gastroenteritis is most infectious from when their symptoms start until\u00a048 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.\nPreventing gastroenteritis\nIt's not always possible to avoid getting\u00a0gastroenteritis, but following the advice below can help stop it spreading:\n\nStay off work, school or nursery until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed. You or your child should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time.\nEnsure you and your child wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they're not always effective.\nDisinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner.\nWash contaminated items of clothing or bedding separately on a hot wash.\nDon't share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils while you or your child is ill.\nFlush away any poo or vomit in the toilet or potty and clean the surrounding area.\nPractice good food hygiene. Make sure food is properly refrigerated, always cook your food thoroughly, and never eat food that is past its use-by date \u2013 read more about preventing food poisoning.\u00a0\n\nTake extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it.\nYoung children can have the\u00a0rotavirus vaccination when they\u2019re 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis.\n"}, {"Name": "Gastro Oesophageal Reflux Disease Gord", "Information": "\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition, where acid from the stomach leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet).\nIt usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened.

One of the types is the same virus that causes cold sores around the mouth (type 1).\nGenital herpes causes painful blisters and sores on and around the genitals. It can also sometimes cause problems if it's caught for the first time either very early or very late in pregnancy.\nHow do I get genital herpes?\nThe herpes virus (HSV) is easily passed from person to person by close, direct contact including:\n\nkissing\nunprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom)\nsharing sex toys that aren't washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used\nyour genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals \u2013 this means you can get genital herpes from someone even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation\n\nSometimes you can catch herpes when your sexual partner has no visible sores or symptoms. This is because the virus can become active on the skin without causing any visible blisters or sores. This is sometimes called 'asymptomatic shedding\u2019.\nHerpes can also be passed to a newborn baby during childbirth. This is less common if the first episode of herpes is diagnosed before or at the beginning of pregnancy, and if there are no visible ulcers at time of delivery. Sometimes medications are started towards the end of pregnancy to reduce this risk.\nSymptoms of genital herpes\nMany people with the herpes virus do not experience any symptoms when first infected.\nIf symptoms do occur they usually take between two and twelve days after contact to appear.\nSometimes symptoms may not be noticed until months, or sometimes years, after being in contact with the virus.\nOnce you have the herpes infection, the virus stays in your body. It can lie dormant for long periods, but can reactivate in the area that was originally infected. If the virus reactivates, the sores and blisters can reappear. This is known as a \u2018recurrent episode\u2019 of genital herpes.\nThis first episode of genital herpes may last from two to four weeks. Repeated episodes are not usually as severe, or long, as the first and you may never have a repeat episode.\nSymptoms of the first infection can include spots or red bumps around the genital area. These can be very painful. In time, these swellings can break open and form sores or ulcers which gradually crust over, forming new skin as they heal.\u00a0\nOther symptoms include:\n\npain inside the vagina, head of penis or back passage (rectum)\nvaginal discharge\npain peeing or being unable to pee\nfever\nflu-like symptoms, backache, headache and a temperature\nmild swelling of the lymph glands in the groin, armpits and neck\n\nIf you have a recurrent infection, your symptoms may include:\n\na tingling or burning sensation before blisters appear (this can signal the start of a recurrent infection)\npainful red blisters, which soon burst to leave ulcers\npain inside the vagina, head of penis or back passage\u00a0\n\nTesting for genital herpes\nIf you think you may have genital herpes you should make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health services.\nIf there are symptoms present such as blisters, sores and ulcers, your doctor or nurse may be able to make a diagnosis straight away.\nIf you have visible blisters, your doctor or nurse may take a swab for testing, to check if this is herpes and what type. This swab can also test for another STI which causes blisters called syphilis.\nThe genital herpes swab tests is very reliable, though if the ulcer is too dry then the result may be less likely to find a positive result.\n"}, {"Name": "Genital Warts", "Information": "\nGenital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection caused by a virus called Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).\nThis virus is passed on through direct skin-to-skin contact with someone who has HPV on their skin. It can be passed from person to person during vaginal and anal sex. It's also rarely passon on through oral sex.\nHow do I get genital warts?\nYou get genital warts by touching your genitals with someone else\u2019s genitals who carries the HPV virus. The virus may be present on the skin but no actual warts can be seen.\nYou can get warts even if you use condoms or don\u2019t have penetrative sex, as a condom does not cover the all of the genital skin.\nSymptoms of genital warts\nIf you have genital warts, you may notice lumps or growths which were not there before around your vagina, penis or anus. However, you can carry the virus without developing actual warts.\nYou may develop symptoms years after you have been in contact with the virus, so it isn\u2019t possible to know when you came in contact with HPV\nIt's common for warts to appear or re-appear during pregnancy due to a change in how the immune system manages the virus.\nTesting for genital warts\nIf you think you may have genital warts you should make an appointment with your GP or contact your local sexual health services.\nIt\u2019s important that warts are diagnosed by a doctor or nurse.\n"}, {"Name": "Germ Cell Tumours", "Information": "\nEach year, fewer than 45 children in the UK develop malignant germ cell tumours. Most children who develop germ cell tumours will be cured.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions, it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nGerm cell tumours\nGerm cell tumours can appear at any age. They develop from cells that produce eggs or sperm so germ cell tumours can affect the ovaries or testes. However, it is possible for a germ cell tumour to develop in other parts of the body.\nAs a baby develops during pregnancy, the cells producing eggs or sperm normally move to the ovaries or testes. However, occasionally they can settle in other parts of the body where they can develop into tumours. The most common places for this to happen are the bottom of the spine (sacrococcygeal), the brain, chest, and abdomen.\nGerm cell tumours are sometimes given different names based on their characteristics. These include yolk-sac tumours, germinomas, embryonal carcinomas, mature teratomas and immature teratomas.\nThey may be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Malignant tumours have the ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body.\nBenign tumours do not spread but may cause problems by pressing on nearby tissue and organs.\nImmature teratomas fall between benign and malignant. They can spread within the abdomen but not beyond, and can be removed with an operation.\nCauses\nThe cause of germ cell tumours is unknown but research into the causes of different cancers is on-going.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe symptoms depend on where the tumour develops. Usually it starts with a lump that can either be felt or causes other symptoms.\nHow germ cell tumours are diagnosed\nDifferent tests may be needed to diagnose a germ cell tumour. Usually, the doctor will remove a sample of tissue from the lump (a biopsy) for examination under a microscope to find out if it is a cancer or not.\nCT or MRI scans may be used to see the exact position of a tumour within the body. Chest X-rays may be taken to see if there\u2019s a tumour in the lungs.\nGerm cell tumours often produce proteins called tumour markers that can be measured in the blood. The ones that are produced by germ cell tumours are alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). Your child will have blood tests to check these tumour markers when they are being diagnosed. The doctors will continue to check these during treatment and after treatment is over.\nSometimes a germ cell tumour can be diagnosed with a tumour marker and scan results so that a biopsy isn\u2019t necessary. This is particularly so if surgery is not needed for treatment, for example if the tumour is in the brain.\nStaging\nThe stage of a cancer describes its size and whether it has spread from where it started. Knowing the stage helps doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nGenerally cancer is divided into four stages:\nStage 1\nThe cancer is small, has not spread and has been completely removed.\nStages 2 and 3\nThe cancer is larger and may not have been completely removed, or may have spread to nearby organs.\nStage 4\nThe cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nCancer that has spread to distant parts of the body and formed new tumours is known as secondary or metastatic cancer.\nTreatment\nThe treatment your child will have usually depends on a number of factors, including the size, position and stage of the tumour. It usually includes either surgery or chemotherapy, or a combination of the two.\nA benign tumour can be cured if it is removed by surgery. It may mean removing a testicle or an ovary if this is where the tumour started.\nIf the tumour is malignant and can be completely removed with surgery, chemotherapy is not always needed, especially if it began in the testis or ovary. If the tumour cannot be removed easily or has spread, your child will be given chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. Germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy. It\u2019s usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein.\nA combination of drugs is usually given every three weeks for three or five months. The length of time chemotherapy is given for depends on the position of the tumour, the level of AFP, and whether or not the tumour has spread.\nTreatment of malignant germ cell tumours in the brain is a little different. Although they are very sensitive to chemotherapy, treatment with radiotherapy is also needed. Radiotherapy is the use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. Unlike germ cell tumours elsewhere in the body, it\u2019s not always necessary to remove germ cell tumours in the brain with surgery.\nSide effects of treatment\nTreatment often causes side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. The operation your child has will be individually planned to try to reduce any possible problems. The surgeon and specialist nurse will discuss this with you.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy usually gradually improve when treatment is over and many of them can be well controlled.\nThe side effects of treatment depend on the drugs used but can include:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\nhair loss\nincreased risk of infection\nbruising and bleeding\ntiredness\ndiarrhoea\n\nLate side effects\nA small number of children may develop long-term side effects of treatment, sometimes many years later. These are not common but may include problems with how the kidneys or lungs work and some hearing loss. Your child\u2019s specialist doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects.\nIf your child has only one ovary or testis removed, they\u2019ll usually still be able to have children in the future.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancers. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nYour child will continue to have regular blood tests during and after treatment, to check their levels of AFP and HCG. If the levels rise, this indicates that the tumour might have come back and further treatment is needed.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Glandular Fever", "Information": "\nGlandular fever is a type of viral infection that mostly affects young adults.\nIt is also known as\u00a0infectious mononucleosis, or \"mono\".\nCommon symptoms include:\n\na high temperature (fever)\na severely\u00a0sore throat\nswollen glands\u00a0in the neck\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\n\nWhile the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks.

However, speak to your GP if your symptoms don't get better or if you experience pain or bleeding.\nYour GP can often diagnose haemorrhoids using a simple internal examination of your back passage, although they may need to refer you to a colorectal specialist for diagnosis and treatment.\nSome people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there\u2019s no need to be embarrassed, because GPs are very used to diagnosing and treating haemorrhoids.\nRead more about diagnosing haemorrhoids.\nWhat causes\u00a0haemorrhoids?\nThe exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear, but\u00a0they're associated with increased pressure in the\u00a0blood vessels in and around your anus. This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed.\nMany cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet, due to prolonged constipation \u2013 this is often due to a lack of\u00a0fibre in a person's diet. Chronic (long-term)\u00a0diarrhoea can also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids.\nOther factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include:\n\nbeing overweight or obese\nage\u00a0\u2013 as you get older, your body's supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids\nbeing\u00a0pregnant\u00a0\u2013 which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more about common pregnancy problems)\nhaving a family history of haemorrhoids\nregularly lifting heavy objects\na\u00a0persistent\u00a0cough or repeated vomiting\nsitting down for long periods of time\n\nPreventing and treating haemorrhoids\u00a0\nHaemorrhoid symptoms often\u00a0settle down after\u00a0a few days, without needing treatment. Haemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth.\nHowever, making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on\u00a0the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. These can include:\n\ngradually\u00a0increasing the amount of fibre in your diet \u2013 good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats\ndrinking plenty of fluid\u00a0\u2013 particularly water,\u00a0but avoiding or\u00a0cutting down on caffeine and alcohol\nnot delaying going to the toilet \u2013 ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet\navoiding medication that causes constipation \u2013 such as painkillers that contain codeine\nlosing weight (if you're overweight)\nexercising regularly \u2013 can help prevent constipation, reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weight\n\nThese measures can also reduce\u00a0the risk of haemorrhoids returning, or even developing\u00a0in the first place.\nMedication that you apply directly to your back passage (known as topical treatments) or tablets bought from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP may ease your symptoms and make it easier for you to pass stools.\nThere are various treatment options for more severe haemorrhoids. One of these options is banding, which is a non-surgical procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off\u00a0its blood supply. The haemorrhoid should fall off\u00a0after about a week.\nSurgery carried out under\u00a0general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) is sometimes\u00a0used to\u00a0remove or shrink\u00a0large or external haemorrhoids.\nRead more about\u00a0treating haemorrhoids\u00a0and surgery for haemorrhoids.\n"}, {"Name": "Hairy Cell Leukaemia", "Information": "\nHairy cell leukaemia is a rare type of long-term (chronic) leukaemia.\nThe condition gets its name from the fine, hair-like strands that develop around the outside of\u00a0the cancerous cells and are visible under\u00a0a microscope.\nIt's not known what causes hairy cell leukaemia.\nLeukaemia\nLeukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells.\nAll the body's blood cells, including\u00a0red and white blood cells\u00a0and platelets, are produced by bone marrow. Bone marrow is a spongy tissue found inside the bones. It\u00a0also produces special cells called stem cells.\nIn leukaemia, the cancer begins in the stem cells and causes them to produce more white blood cells than are needed. Over time, the\u00a0build-up of cancerous white blood cells disrupts the normal balance of cells in the blood.\nThis means your body doesn't have enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body,\u00a0or platelets, which help stop bleeding. This can lead to the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath\u00a0and feeling faint, as well as increasing the risk of excessive bleeding.\nAlso, as the white blood cells aren't properly developed, they're less effective at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nHairy cell leukaemia\nThe symptoms of hairy cell leukaemia develop slowly and are\u00a0similar to\u00a0those of\u00a0other types of leukaemia. They include:\n\nweight\u00a0loss\u00a0\npale skin\nweakness, tiredness and breathlessness (due to a lack of red blood cells)\nfrequent\u00a0infections (due to a lack of infection-fighting white blood cells)\nbleeding or bruising easily\npain or swelling in your abdomen (tummy) (see below)\n\nThe abnormal white blood cells can accumulate in your spleen, causing it to increase in size. The spleen is an organ\u00a0in the upper left side of your abdomen, behind your stomach and ribs.\nIf your spleen is enlarged, it's likely you'll have a painful lump on the left side of your abdomen. If this is the case, you should visit your GP so the lump can be examined.\nAn enlarged spleen may remove normal blood cells from your bloodstream. This can lead to a further reduction in the number of normal red and white blood cells and platelets in your blood.\nDiagnosis\nIf\u00a0your GP\u00a0suspects leukaemia, they may refer you to a haematologist (a specialist in blood disorders).\nThe haematologist will carry out\u00a0blood tests\u00a0to determine how many\u00a0different types of blood cells there are in your blood sample. This is known as a full blood count (FBC) and will indicate the number of abnormal white blood cells you have.\nIf you have hairy cell leukaemia, it's\u00a0likely your red blood cell and platelet counts will be low.\nA bone marrow\u00a0sample may also be taken which will give the haematologist more detailed information about your condition.\nAn ultrasound scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan may be needed to examine your spleen.\nTreatment\nAs hairy cell leukaemia develops slowly, immediate treatment\u00a0may not be needed. You'll have regular blood tests to monitor your condition.\nTreatment may be recommended if\u00a0the number of abnormal white blood cells\u00a0increases or if you develop symptoms.\nA\u00a0number of different treatments are available for hairy cell leukaemia.\u00a0Chemotherapy\u00a0is the main treatment and it's usually effective at destroying the cancerous cells.\nOther treatments are sometimes\u00a0used in combination with chemotherapy.\nRituximab is a type of\u00a0medication known as a monoclonal antibody. It seeks out a protein found on leukaemia cells and attaches itself to it. The immune system then targets and kills the cells.\nInterferon is another medicine that can be used to treat hairy cell leukaemia. It\u00a0can\u00a0strengthen your immune system and help fight cancer. This type of treatment, known as immunotherapy, may be recommended\u00a0if you can't have chemotherapy or rituximab, or they're no longer working.\nSurgery to remove the spleen is rarely used\u00a0as a treatment for\u00a0hairy cell leukaemia.\u00a0However, removal of your spleen may be recommended if:\n\nit's enlarged and is causing pain or discomfort\nit's destroying large numbers of red blood cells or platelets\nit hasn't shrunk after chemotherapy\n\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the types of treatment for hairy cell leukaemia.\nOutlook\nAs with most types of cancer, the outlook for hairy cell leukaemia will depend on how far the condition\u00a0has advanced at the time of diagnosis and how well it responds to treatment.\nAs hairy cell leukaemia is a\u00a0rare type of cancer, it's difficult to accurately predict how it will affect individuals in the long-term.\u00a0\nHowever, according to Cancer Research UK, at least 96 out of 100 people diagnosed with hairy cell leukaemia (96%) will live\u00a0at least 10 years after being\u00a0diagnosed.\n"}, {"Name": "Hand Foot And Mouth Disease", "Information": "\nHand, foot and mouth disease is a common infection that causes mouth ulcers and spots on the hands and feet.\nIt's most common in young children\u00a0\u2013 particularly those under\u00a010 \u2013 but can affect older children and adults as well.\nHand, foot and mouth disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7 to 10 days.

However, it may be higher if blood is present, such as menstrual blood or from minor bleeding during anal sex.\nCondoms aren't usually necessary to prevent hepatitis C for long-term heterosexual couples, but it's a very good idea to use them when having anal sex or sex with a new partner.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"Name": "Hiatus Hernia", "Information": "\nA hiatus hernia, or hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (\"hiatus\") in the diaphragm.\nThe diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle\u00a0between the chest\u00a0and the abdomen (tummy).\nHiatus hernia and heartburn\nA hiatus hernia itself rarely\u00a0has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called\u00a0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\nGORD is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly.\nYour oesophagus can become\u00a0severely irritated, because it's not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour\u00a0taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (dysphagia).\nYou should see your GP if you have frequent and severe symptoms of GORD.\nWhat causes a hiatus hernia?\nIt's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen.\nHiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn't develop properly.\nWho's affected\nHiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it's more common in people who are:\n\nover 50 years of age\noverweight\npregnant\n\nIt's estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia.\nThere's also a\u00a0rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which\u00a0is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm.

When the two combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoprotein.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver. From there it's either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product. For this reason, HDL is referred to as \"good cholesterol\" and higher levels are better.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol to the cells that need it. If there's too much cholesterol for the cells to use it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries. For this reason, LDL is known as \"bad cholesterol\".\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe amount of cholesterol in the blood, both HDL and LDL ,\u00a0is measured with a blood test.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease.\n\nWhy should I lower my cholesterol?\nEvidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of:\n\nnarrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)\u00a0\nheart attack\u00a0\nstroke\u00a0\ntransient ischaemic attack (TIA)\u00a0\u2013 often known as a\u00a0\"mini stroke\"\nperipheral arterial disease (PAD)\n\nThis is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a\u00a0blood clot developing somewhere in your body.\nYour risk of\u00a0developing coronary heart disease\u00a0also rises as your blood's cholesterol level increases. This can cause\u00a0pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity\u00a0(angina).\nWhat causes high cholesterol?\nMany factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol.\nThese include:\n\nan unhealthy diet \u2013 in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat\nsmoking\u00a0\u2013 a chemical called acrolin, found in cigarettes, stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)\nhaving diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension)\nhaving a family history of stroke or heart disease\n\nThere's also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia. This can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily.\nRead more about the causes of high cholesterol\nWhen should my cholesterol levels be tested?\nYour GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you:\n\nhave been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\nhave a family history of early\u00a0cardiovascular disease\nhave a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition\nare overweight\nhave high blood pressure, diabetes or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels\n\nRead more about how cholesterol is tested\nWhat should my cholesterol levels be?\nBlood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol/L.\nAs a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be:\n\n5mmol/L or less for healthy adults\n4mmol/L or less for those at high risk\n\nAs a general guide, LDL levels should be:\n\n3mmol/L or less for healthy adults\n2mmol/L or less for those at high risk\n\nAn ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease.\nYour ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease.\nCholesterol is only one risk factor. The level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present.\nHow can I lower my cholesterol level?\nThe first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. It's important to keep your diet low in fatty food.\nYou can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help\u00a0prevent high cholesterol returning.\nOther lifestyle changes, such as\u00a0taking regular exercise and\u00a0giving up smoking, can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol.\nIf these measures don't reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins.\nYour GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins. The benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks.\nRead more about how high cholesterol is treated\n"}, {"Name": "Hiv", "Information": "\nHIV is a long term health condition which is now very easy to manage. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus.

Unprotected sex means having sex without taking HIV PrEP or using condoms.\nHIV can also be transmitted by:\n\nsharing infected needles and other injecting equipment\nan HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding\n\nAll pregnant women are offered an HIV test and if the virus is found, they can be offered treatment which virtually eliminates risk to their child during pregnancy and birth.\nPeople who take HIV treatment and whose virus level is undetectable can't pass HIV on to others. Although there is no cure for HIV yet, people living with HIV who take their treatment should have normal lifespans and live in good health.\nWithout treatment, people with HIV will eventually become unwell. HIV can be fatal if it's not detected and treated in time to allow the immune system to repair. It's extremely important to test for HIV if you think you've been exposed.\nHow do you get HIV?\nHIV is found in body fluids of a person with the virus, whose levels of virus are detectable.\nThe body fluids most likely to contain enough virus to pass on HIV to another person are:\n\nsemen (including pre-cum)\nvaginal fluid\nanal mucus\nblood\nbreast milk\n\nHIV is a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.\nHIV is most commonly passed on through unprotected anal or vaginal sex.

This involves testing a sample of your blood or occasionally saliva for signs of the infection. In NHS services this usually involves a blood test with results available within a few days.\nSome services, including HIV or sexual health charities, may provide saliva tests. Saliva tests that indicate a person may have HIV will need to be confirmed through a blood test.\nIt's important to be aware that:\n\nHIV tests may need to be repeated four weeks after potential exposure to HIV, this is known as the \"window period\", but you shouldn't wait this long to seek help\nyou can get tested in a number of places, including your GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities\nclinic tests can sometimes give you a result in minutes, although it may take a few days to get the result of a more detailed blood test\nhome-testing or home-sampling kits are available to buy or order online or from pharmacies \u2013 depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days\n\nIf the test shows you have HIV, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.\nRead more about diagnosing HIV\nTreating and living with HIV\nTreatments for HIV are now very effective, enabling people with HIV to live long and healthy lives.\nMedication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines usually come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.\nHIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but taking a combination of different drugs makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of 3 antiretrovirals (although some people take 1 or 2) and it's vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.\nTaking a number of different drugs doesn\u2019t always mean taking many tablets though as some drugs are combined together into one tablet.\nFor people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is \"undetectable\" in blood tests) will prevent you passing on HIV to sexual partners.\nIt's extremely rare for a pregnant woman living with HIV to transmit it to their babies, provided they receive timely and effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care. An HIV test is routinely offered to all women in Scotland as part of antenatal screening.\nRead more about living with HIV\nPreventing HIV\nIt has never been easier to prevent the transmission of HIV.\nSomeone living with HIV who takes their HIV treatment and who has had an undetectable level of virus for six months, cannot transmit HIV to anyone else. Over 90% of all people diagnosed with HIV in Scotland have undetectable virus. It's therefore extremely rare for someone to get HIV from a person that knows they have the virus.\nHIV Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP is a form of HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV which will help to prevent them from getting HIV. In Scotland PrEP is available on the NHS through sexual health clinics for people who are at risk of getting HIV. PrEP only provides protection from HIV and not from any other sexually transmitted infections.\nCondoms (and lubricant)\nProperly used condoms (and lubricant for anal sex) are effective at preventing transmission of HIV as well as other sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.\nHIV Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)\nHIV\u00a0Post exposure prophylaxis\u00a0(PEP) is a form of emergency\u00a0HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV but\u00a0who has or may have been very recently exposed to HIV.\nPEP should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. The earlier it is taken the more effective it is.\nClean Injecting Equipment\nUsing fresh injecting equipment, including any needles, syringes, swabs and spoons and avoiding sharing will eliminate any risk of HIV.\nHow common is HIV?\nAt the end of 2017, there were an estimated 5099 people in Scotland living with HIV. The majority got the virus through sex.\nAround 1 in every 1087 people in the Scotland has HIV, but the three groups with highest rates of HIV are:\n\ngay and bisexual men or other men who have sex with men\npeople from countries with high HIV prevalence, especially sub Saharan African countries\npeople who share injecting equipment (including needles, syringes, spoons and swabs) or who have sex with people who inject drugs\n\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that around 36.9 million people in the world are living with HIV.\n"}, {"Name": "Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Information": "\nHodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.\nThe lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes.\nIn Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nRead more about the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma.\nWho's affected?\nHodgkin lymphoma\u00a0can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. Slightly more men than women are affected.\nAround 1,900 people are diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK each year.\nWhat causes Hodgkin lymphoma?\nThe exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if:\n\nyou\u00a0have a medical condition that weakens your immune system\nyou take immunosuppressant medication\nyou've previously been exposed to\u00a0a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which causes glandular fever\n\nYou also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition.\nRead more about the causes of Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHow Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed\nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a\u00a0biopsy.\nThis is a minor surgical procedure where\u00a0a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.\nRead more about diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma.\nTreatment and outlook\nHodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it's also one of the most easily treated types of cancer.\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body.\u00a0How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.\nThe main treatments used are\u00a0chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Surgery isn't generally used as a treatment for the condition.\nOverall,\u00a0around 85% of people with Hodgkin lymphoma live at least five years and most of these will be cured. However, there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.\nRead more about:\n\ntreatment for Hodgkin lymphoma\ncomplications of Hodgkin lymphoma\n\n"}, {"Name": "Hodgkin Lymphoma Children", "Information": "\nHodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It can affect children at any age but is more common in older teenagers and young adults. Each year in the UK, there are around 70 children aged 0-14 years, 120 young people aged 15-19 years, and 180 young people aged 20-24 years, diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nWhat is Hodgkin lymphoma?\nHodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the lymphatic system. There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which affects 95% of patients, and Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL), which only affects 5% of patients. This information is about classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but it includes a short section about LPHL.\nThe lymphatic system\nThe lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body\u2019s natural defence against infection and disease.\nThe lymphatic system is made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (or lymph glands). Lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels that contain lymph fluid. Lymphomas can start anywhere in the lymphatic system, but Hodgkin Lymphoma is most likely to start in the lymph nodes in the neck. The other areas where lymph nodes are likely to swell are above the collar bone, the armpit, the groin and inside the chest. Glands can swell in these areas as part of the body\u2019s response to infection, not just cancer, which is why a biopsy is needed to diagnose lymphoma.\nThe number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. In some parts of the body, there are very few lymph nodes, whereas under your arm there may be 20-50.\nThere are two main types of lymphoma:\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Although these are both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is not known. In most people that develop Hodgkin lymphoma, no cause is found. However, there is increasing evidence that infections, such as the virus that causes glandular fever, may play a part in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma, especially in childhood. Poor immunity may also be a risk factor for developing the disease. Very rarely, more than one member of a family may develop Hodgkin lymphoma but it is not inherited from parents and you cannot catch it from another person.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe first sign of Hodgkin lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of one gland, or a group of lymph glands, which continues for some weeks or even months. The first glands that are likely to be affected are in the neck or above the collarbone, most often only on one side. However, it\u2019s important to remember that children\u2019s glands can also become swollen when they have a common infection that causes a sore throat or a cold. If glands in the chest are affected, this can cause a cough or breathlessness. This is caused by the pressure the glands exert on the airways.\nSometimes, a child with Hodgkin lymphoma may have a high temperature (fever), night sweats, weight loss or itchy skin.\nHow Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed\nAs lymph glands can swell for lots of reasons, a biopsy is carried out to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. A biopsy is when a swollen lymph gland is removed and the cells are looked at under a microscope. It\u2019s a small operation which is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Sometimes only a small part of the lymph gland has to be removed, which can be done under a local anaesthetic.\nIf Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed after the biopsy, further tests are carried out to find out the exact size and position of the lymphoma, and to see whether it has spread beyond the original area. These tests include x-rays, blood tests, CT, MRI and PET scans.\nVery often, a bone marrow sample will be taken. This is because the lymphoma cells can spread to the bone marrow as well as to other lymph glands.\nThe tests that are carried out are called staging tests. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve.\nStaging\nThe stage of Hodgkin lymphoma describes the size and position of the cancer and whether it has spread. Staging is very important because the type of treatment your child receives will depend on the stage of the disease. The staging system for Hodgkin lymphoma is as follows:\nStage 1\nOnly one group of lymph nodes is affected and the lymphoma is only on one side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs that controls breathing).\nStage 2\nTwo or more groups of lymph nodes are affected, but they are only on one side of the diaphragm.\nStage 3\nThe lymphoma is in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm.\nStage 4\nThe lymphoma has spread outside the lymph nodes to other organs such as the liver, lungs or bone marrow.\nAs well as giving each stage a number, doctors also use a letter code - either A, B, or E:\n\nA means your child has no symptoms.\nB means your child has one or more of the following symptoms: a fever, night sweats or significant weight loss.\nE means that the lymphoma has grown from the lymph gland to extranodal tissue (tissue in places outside the lymph nodes).\n\nA number and letter is used in the staging of every child with Hodgkin lymphoma. This helps the doctor decide on a treatment plan for your child.\nTreatment\nChildren with Hodgkin lymphoma are usually treated with chemotherapy, but sometimes radiotherapy is also needed. The type and amount of treatment given depend on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you.\nChemotherapy\nThis is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.\nIt is usual for a combination of drugs to be used, which will often be given every few weeks over a number of months. A combination of drugs is used because each chemotherapy drug works in a different way. Using several drugs together increases the effectiveness of the treatment. It also means lower doses of individual drugs can be used, which may reduce the possibility of long-term side effects.\nRadiotherapy\nThis is used in less than half of people with Hodgkin lymphoma. It treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.\nSide effects of treatment\nTreatment for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the particular treatment being used and the part of the body that is being treated.\nSome general side effects of chemotherapy that can occur during treatment include:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\nhair loss\nlow blood count which can lead to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding\ntiredness\n\nChanges to your child\u2019s sense of taste and changes in their bowel may also happen. If your child has side effects from the treatment it is important to discuss them with your doctor or nurse. They may be able to help reduce them.\nLate side effects of treatment\nThe cure rate for Hodgkin lymphoma is very high, which means some children may develop side effects many years after treatment. The chance of developing late side effects depends on where the original tumour was, how far it spread, and the type of treatment your child had.\nThese late side effects can affect the normal organs such as the heart, kidneys and lungs. Following treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, there is a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. There is also a chance that fertility may be affected. Teenage boys who are diagnosed after puberty should have the option of sperm banking before treatment starts. In this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years.\nYour child\u2019s doctor or nurse will explain more about any possible late side effects.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version.\nThe aim of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is to cure the cancer with the fewest possible short and long-term side effects. This is particularly important in childhood Hodgkin lymphoma where cure rates are high. It is important to get the balance right between curing the cancer and having the lowest risk of long-term side effects.\nIf appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you may have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it\u2019s right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nAbout 90% of children who develop Hodgkin lymphoma are cured. When your child completes treatment, they will then go into a follow-up phase, seeing doctors and nurses in out-patient clinics usually for around five years. Clinic visits will be every 3-4 months to start with and there will be occasional scans, x-rays, and blood tests done for several years after completing treatment.\nIf the cancer comes back, a different course of treatment can be given. If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation.\nLymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (LPHL)\nThis is a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma that affects around 5% of patients. LPHL usually grows at a slower rate than classical Hodgkin lymphoma and normally requires less intensive treatment. Young people with LPHL may have a single swollen gland or group of swollen glands in one area only, such as the neck or groin. The swollen gland often grows very slowly and may be present for many months before a biopsy and diagnosis happens. The biopsy and staging tests will be carried out as with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment given will depend on the stage of the disease, but most patients are diagnosed with an early stage of the disease.\nLPHL is usually treated with surgery or low-dose chemotherapy. It may return many years after treatment, and further treatment may be required, but it is rarely a life-threatening condition. In rare cases, patients have advanced LPHL and receive more intensive chemotherapy. There is also a link between LPHL and developing a more aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Hodgkin Lymphoma Teenagers And Young Adults", "Information": "\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma has a very good success rate and most people are cured.\nHodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is one of the body\u2019s natural defences against infection.\nLymphomas, like all cancers, are a disease of the body\u2019s cells. Normally cells in our body divide and grow in a controlled way. But sometimes cells keep dividing and grow out of control. This is how cancer develops.\nIn lymphomas, white blood cells called lymphocytes become abnormal and grow out of control. These lymphocytes can build up in one part of the body and form a lump (tumour).\nThere are two main types of lymphoma:\n\nHodgkin lymphoma\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)\u00a0\n\nAlthough these cancers are both lymphomas, they are different and need different treatments. Your doctors will do tests to find out which type you have.\nSymptoms\nOne of the most common symptoms is having a painless lump. The lump is caused by swollen lymph nodes. There may be one or more lumps and these may be in your neck, armpit or groin.\nLumps can also be inside the body. A commonplace would be inside the chest and this can cause a cough or breathlessness.\nSome people feel tired and lethargic with lymphoma. Itching of the skin is also quite common.\nSome people with Hodgkin lymphoma have other symptoms such as high temperatures, very heavy sweats (especially at night) and unexplained weight loss. Doctors call these symptoms \u2018B symptoms\u2019.\nMost of the symptoms that people get with lymphoma may also be caused by other illnesses. For example swollen lymph nodes, high temperatures and sweats may be caused by an infection. But if you have any of these symptoms or are worried that you may have Hodgkin lymphoma, go to your GP. They'll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.\nCauses\nWe don't know what causes Hodgkin lymphoma, but research is going on to try to find out. Remember, though, it isn't anything that you\u2019ve done.\nHodgkin lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in young people over the age of 10. About 1 in 6 of all cancers affecting young people between 15 and 24 is a Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHodgkin lymphoma isn\u2019t infectious and can\u2019t be passed on to other people or family members.\nIf you\u2019re looking for information about Hodgkin lymphoma in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0Hodgkin lymphoma section.\n"}, {"Name": "Huntingtons Disease", "Information": "\nHuntington's disease is an inherited condition that damages certain nerve cells in the brain.\nThis brain damage gets progressively worse over time and can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and behaviour.\nEarly features can include personality changes, mood swings, fidgety movements, irritability and altered behaviour, although these are often overlooked and attributed to something else.\nRead more about\u00a0the features of Huntington's disease\nHuntington's disease was\u00a0originally called Huntington's chorea (\"chorea\" is the Greek word for dancing).

It's been estimated to affect between 1\u00a0and 3\u00a0in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the UK.\nHyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty.\n"}, {"Name": "Hypoglycaemia Low Blood Sugar", "Information": "\nHypoglycaemia, or a \"hypo\", is an abnormally low level of glucose in your blood (less than four millimoles per litre).\nWhen your glucose (sugar)\u00a0level is too\u00a0low, your body doesn't have enough energy to carry out its activities.\nHypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with diabetes, and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard.\nIn rare cases, it's possible for a person who doesn't have diabetes\u00a0to experience hypoglycaemia. It can be triggered by malnutrition,\u00a0binge drinking or certain conditions, such as Addison's disease.\nRead more about the causes of hypoglycaemia\nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia\nMost people will have some warning that their blood\u00a0glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.\nTypical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness.\nIt's also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking.\nRead more about the symptoms of hypoglycaemia\nCorrecting hypoglycaemia\nThe immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some food or drink that contains sugar, such as dextrose tablets or fruit juice, to correct your blood glucose levels.\nAfter having something sugary, you may need to have a longer-acting \"starchy\" carbohydrate food, such as\u00a0a sandwich or a\u00a0few biscuits.\nIf hypoglycaemia causes a loss of consciousness, an injection of the hormone glucagon can be given to raise blood glucose levels and restore consciousness.

The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.\nAfter the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.\nThe sores aren't painful, but they may be itchy.

Having diabetes could affect how your toenail heals.\nWhat causes ingrown toenails?\nA number of things can cause an ingrown toenail to develop, including:\n\nbadly cut toenails \u2013 cutting your toenails too short, or cutting the edges, will encourage the skin to fold over your nail and the nail to grow into the skin\nwearing tight-fitting shoes, socks or tights \u2013 this places pressure on the skin around your toenail; the skin may be pierced if it's pressed on to your toenail\nsweaty feet \u2013 if the skin around your toenails is soft, it's easier for your nail to pierce it and embed itself within it\ninjury \u2013 for example, stubbing your toe can sometimes cause an ingrown toenail to develop\nnatural shape of the nail \u2013 the sides of curved or fan-shaped toenails are more likely to press into the skin surrounding the nail\n\nA\u00a0fungal nail infection can cause your toenail to thicken or widen.\nTreating ingrown toenails\nLeft untreated, an ingrown toenail can become infected, so it\u2019s important that you:\n\nkeep your feet clean by washing them regularly with soap and water\nchange your socks regularly\ncut your toenails straight across to stop them digging into the surrounding skin\ngently push the skin away from the nail using a cotton bud (this may be easier after using a small amount of olive oil to soften the skin)\nwear comfortable shoes that fit properly\n\nSurgery may be recommended if your toenail doesn't improve. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may involve removing part or all of your toenail.\nPartial nail avulsion\nPartial nail avulsion removes part of your toenail and is the most commonly used operation for treating ingrown toenails. It's about 98% effective.\nA\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0is used to numb your toe and the edges of your toenail are cut away. A chemical called phenol is applied to the affected area to prevent the nail growing back and becoming ingrown in the future.\nA course of\u00a0antibiotics may be prescribed if your nail is infected, and any pus will be drained away.\nTotal nail avulsion\nTotal nail avulsion completely removes your toenail. This may be necessary if your nail is thick and pressing into the skin surrounding your toe. After your toenail has been removed, you\u2019ll have an indentation where your nail used to be. However, it's perfectly safe for you not to have a toenail.\nAfter surgery\nAfter toenail surgery, your toe will be wrapped in a sterile bandage. This will help stem any bleeding and prevent infection. Rest your foot and keep it raised for 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0days after the operation.\nTo help reduce the pain, you may need to take a painkiller, such as paracetamol, and wear soft or open-toed shoes for the first few days after surgery.\nPreventing ingrown toenails\nTaking care of your feet will help prevent foot problems such as ingrown toenails. It\u2019s important to cut your toenails properly (straight across, not at an angle or down the edges).\nWash your feet every day, dry them thoroughly and use foot moisturiser. You can also use a foot file or pumice stone to remove hard or dead skin.\nWearing shoes that fit properly will help to ensure your feet remain healthy.

If someone has a faulty gene, there\u2019s a 50/50 chance it can be passed on to your children.\nThe effects of these conditions on you and your family can be enormous. These conditions can - in some cases - become life-threatening. Around 500 young people die every year in the UK as a result of a genetic heart disorder.\nThese conditions do not always have symptoms, so you can be unaware you have the conditions. Sadly, this can sometimes mean that the first time a family is aware of being affected is after a sudden cardiac death (SCD).\nHowever, great improvements are being made in the detection of ICCs and also how you can live with your condition.

It can limit what you're able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues.\nHow much sleep do I need?\nThere are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different.\nOn average, a \"normal\" amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.\nWhat's important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.\nYou're probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it's affecting your everyday life.\nWhat causes insomnia?\nIt's not always clear what triggers insomnia, but it's often associated with:\n\nstress and anxiety\na poor sleeping environment \u2013 such as an uncomfortable bed, or a bedroom that's too light, noisy, hot or cold\nlifestyle factors \u2013 such as jet lag, shift work, or drinking alcohol or caffeine before going to bed\nmental health conditions \u2013 such as\u00a0depression and schizophrenia\nphysical health conditions \u2013 such as heart problems,\u00a0other sleep disorders and long-term pain\ncertain medicines \u2013 such as some antidepressants,\u00a0epilepsy medicines and\u00a0steroid medication\n\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of insomnia\nWhat you can\u00a0do about it\nThere are a number of things you can try to help yourself get a good night's sleep if you have insomnia.\nThese include:\n\nsetting regular times for going to bed and waking up\nrelaxing before bed time\u00a0\u2013 try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music\nusing thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise\navoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals\u00a0and exercise for a few hours before going to bed\nnot watching TV or using phones, tablets or computers shortly before\u00a0going to bed\u00a0\nnot napping during the day\nwriting a list of your worries, and any ideas\u00a0about\u00a0how to\u00a0solve them, before going to bed to help you forget about\u00a0them until the morning\n\nSome people find over-the-counter sleeping tablets helpful, but they don't address the underlying problem and can have troublesome side effects.\nRead more\u00a0self-help tips for insomnia\nWhen to see your GP\nMake an appointment to see your GP if you're finding it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep and it's affecting your daily life \u2013 particularly if it has been a problem for a month or more and the above measures have not helped.\nYour GP may ask you about your sleeping routines, your daily alcohol and caffeine consumption, and your general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise.\nThey will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia.\nYour GP may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns.\nEach day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night.\nTreatments for\u00a0insomnia\nYour GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems.\nThey'll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep.\nIn some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended.\nThis is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. It's usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep.\nPrescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time.\nThis is because they don't treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time.\nRead more about treating insomnia\n"}, {"Name": "Iron Deficiency Anaemia", "Information": "\nIron deficiency anaemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells.\nIron is used to produce red blood cells, which\u00a0help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would.\nThere are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type.\nOther types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body\u00a0\u2013 read more about vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia.\nSymptoms of iron deficiency anaemia\nMany people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops.\nYou may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a stomach ulcer.\nThe most common symptoms\u00a0include:\n\ntiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)\nshortness of breath\nnoticeable heartbeats\u00a0(heart palpitations)\na pale complexion\n\nLess common symptoms\u00a0include:\n\nheadache\u00a0\nhearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source\u00a0(tinnitus)\nan altered sense of taste\nfeeling itchy\na sore or\u00a0abnormally smooth tongue\nhair loss\na desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica)\ndifficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\npainful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth\nspoon-shaped nails\n\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia. They should be able to diagnose the condition using a simple\u00a0blood test.\nRead more about diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia\nWhat causes iron deficiency anaemia?\nThere are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.\nThis can be caused by a stomach ulcer, stomach cancer, bowel cancer, or by taking\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nIn women\u00a0of reproductive age,\u00a0heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby\u00a0during pregnancy.\nUnless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you're more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.\nRead more about the causes of iron deficiency anaemia\nHow iron deficiency anaemia is treated\nTreatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to\u00a0boost the\u00a0low levels of\u00a0iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes\u00a0long-term problems.\nYou'll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal.\nThe underlying cause will need to be treated so you don't get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended.\nGood sources of iron include:\n\ndark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale\niron-fortified cereals or bread\nbrown rice\u00a0\npulses and beans\nnuts and seeds\nmeat, fish and\u00a0tofu\neggs\ndried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins\n\nRead more about treating iron deficiency anaemia\nFurther problems\nIf iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects\u00a0the body's natural defence system\u00a0(the immune system).\nSevere iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or\u00a0heart failure, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.\nPregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth.\nRead more about the complications of iron deficiency anaemia\n"}, {"Name": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome Ibs", "Information": "\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, long-term condition of the digestive system. Symptoms can include stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and/or constipation.\nIBS is thought to affect up to one in five people at some point in their life, and it usually first develops when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age. Around twice as many women are affected as men.\nThe condition is often lifelong, although the symptoms may change over several years.\nIBS does not pose a serious threat to your physical health and doesn't increase your chances of developing cancer or other bowel-related conditions.\nIBS symptoms\nThe symptoms of IBS vary between individuals and affect some people more severely than others. Symptoms can become worse, often during times of stress or after eating certain foods.\nYou may find some of the symptoms of IBS ease after going to the toilet and moving your bowels.\nRead more about\u00a0the symptoms of IBS\nWhen to see your GP\nVisit your GP if you have IBS symptoms. Your GP will carry out some\u00a0blood tests\u00a0to rule out other conditions.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing IBS\nWhat causes IBS?\nThe exact cause of IBS is unknown. Many causes have been suggested but none have been proven to directly lead to IBS.\nThe symptoms of IBS are very similar to many other conditions.

These tests include:\n\nan\u00a0X-ray to see if there's a problem with your child's bones\nblood tests\u00a0to look for a bone or joint infection\nan\u00a0ultrasound scan that will highlight any fluid that may be on the joint\n\nIf there's fluid on the joint, a sample can be removed and checked for an infection. Just removing the fluid from the joint can ease the symptoms.\nWhat causes irritable hip?\nThe condition\u00a0develops when the lining that covers the hip joint (the synovial membrane) becomes irritated and inflamed, although the cause of inflammation is unclear.\nSome cases of irritable hip occur\u00a0following a viral infection in the chest, throat or digestive system. Many experts think the synovial membrane in the hip becomes inflamed as a complication of the infection. However, there is no hard evidence to support this theory.\nAnother theory is that a hip injury may cause the swelling, although many cases develop in children who do not have a history of injury.\nWho is affected?\nIrritable hip can affect boys and girls of any age, but is most common between the age of four and\u00a010 years old. The condition affects twice as many boys than girls.\nIs it serious?\nAs a parent, it can be very worrying if your child is diagnosed with irritable hip and is struggling to walk. However, the condition is usually short-lived.\nMost cases don't require specific treatment, because the pain usually passes within two weeks.\nA small number of children with irritable hip go on to have further episodes. However, these episodes usually become less frequent and\u00a0eventually stop when the child is older.\nRecovery\nIbuprofen, which is available over the counter, can be used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.\u00a0Your child\u00a0should also rest the affected leg until symptoms have passed.\nMassaging the affected hip and applying heat may also help to reduce your child's hip pain.\nIt usually takes a couple of weeks to recover from irritable hip, although your GP may recommend that your child does not play sport or take part in any strenuous activities for at least another two weeks following treatment. This is to reduce the chances of irritable hip returning.\nSwimming is a good way to strengthen the joint and get it moving again.\nA follow-up appointment may be needed up to six months later. This is to rule out other hip conditions that can also cause pain, stiffness and a limp.\n"}, {"Name": "Itching", "Information": "\nItching is an unpleasant sensation that compels a person to scratch the affected area.

It can affect the skin and internal organs.\nIt's mainly seen in people with a poorly controlled or severe HIV infection. It can\u00a0also affect some people who have a weakened immune system for another reason, as well as people who have\u00a0a genetic vulnerability to the virus.\nSee\u00a0What causes Kaposi's sarcoma?\u00a0for more information.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe most common initial symptom is the appearance of small, painless, flat and discoloured patches on the skin or inside the mouth. They're usually red or purple and look similar to bruises.\nOver time, the patches may grow into lumps known as nodules and may merge into each other.\nInternal organs can also be affected, including the\u00a0lymph nodes, lungs and the digestive system, which\u00a0can cause symptoms such as:\n\nuncomfortable swelling in the arms or legs (lymphoedema)\nbreathlessness, coughing up blood\u00a0and\u00a0chest pain\nnausea, vomiting, stomach pain\u00a0and diarrhoea\n\nThe rate at which symptoms progress depends on the type of Kaposi's sarcoma you have.\u00a0Most types get worse quickly in a matter of weeks or months without treatment, but some progress very slowly over many years.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see your GP if you have any worrying symptoms you think could be caused by Kaposi's sarcoma.\u00a0If you have HIV, you can also contact your local HIV clinic\u00a0if you have any concerns.\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your skin to look for the characteristic discoloured patches. If they suspect Kaposi's sarcoma, they will refer you for further tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nThese tests may include:\n\nan HIV test \u2013 a blood test to confirm whether or not you have HIV (if you haven't already been diagnosed with the condition)\na skin biopsy\u00a0\u2013 where a small sample of cells is removed from an affected area of skin and\u00a0checked for Kaposi's sarcoma cells\nan\u00a0endoscopy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat to see if your lungs or digestive system are affected\na\u00a0computerised tomography (CT)\u00a0scan to see if\u00a0your lymph nodes or other parts of your body are affected\n\nWhat causes Kaposi's sarcoma?\nKaposi's sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is thought to be\u00a0spread during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth.\nHHV-8 is a relatively common virus and the vast majority of people who have it will not develop Kaposi's sarcoma.\u00a0It only seems to cause cancer in some people with a weakened immune system and in some people who have\u00a0a genetic vulnerability to the virus.\nA weakened immune system allows the HHV-8 virus to multiply to high levels in the blood, which increases the chance it will cause Kaposi's sarcoma.\nThe\u00a0virus\u00a0appears to alter the genetic instructions that control cell growth. This means some cells reproduce uncontrollably and form lumps of tissue known as tumours.\nTypes of Kaposi's sarcoma and their treatment\nThere are four main types of Kaposi's sarcoma. These types affect different groups of people and are treated in different ways.\nHIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma\nAlthough it's not as common as it used to be, Kaposi's sarcoma is still one of the main types of cancer to affect people with HIV.\u00a0\nHIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma can progress very quickly if not treated. However, it can usually be controlled by taking HIV medication \u2013 known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) \u2013 to prevent HIV multiplying and allow the immune system to recover. The immune system can then reduce the levels of HHV-8 in the body.\nRead more about treating HIV.\nSome people may also require treatment with\u00a0radiotherapy\u00a0(where high-energy rays are used\u00a0to destroy cancer cells) or\u00a0chemotherapy (where powerful medications are used to destroy cancer cells), depending on the site and extent of the cancer and what symptoms it's causing.\nClassic Kaposi's sarcoma\nClassic Kaposi's sarcoma mainly affects middle-aged and elderly men of Mediterranean or Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Jewish communities that lived in central and eastern Europe. Most Jewish people in\u00a0the UK\u00a0are Ashkenazi Jews.\nIt's thought people who develop classic Kaposi's sarcoma were born with a genetic vulnerability to the HHV-8 virus.\nUnlike the other types of Kaposi's sarcoma,\u00a0the symptoms of classic Kaposi's sarcoma progress very slowly over many years and are usually\u00a0limited to the skin.\nImmediate treatment isn't usually required because, in many cases, the condition doesn't affect\u00a0life expectancy. You'll usually be monitored carefully and only treated if the symptoms get significantly worse.\nRadiotherapy is\u00a0often used if treatment is required, although small\u00a0skin patches or nodules may be removed using minor surgery or cryotherapy (freezing).\nTransplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma\nTransplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma is a rare complication of an organ transplant.\u00a0It occurs because the immunosuppressant medication used to weaken the immune system and help prevent the body rejecting the new organ can allow a previous HHV-8 infection to reactivate, which means levels of the virus increase as it starts multiplying again.\nTransplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma can be aggressive and usually needs to be treated quickly. It's\u00a0normally treated by reducing or stopping the immunosuppressants, if this is possible. If this is unsuccessful, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used.\nEndemic African Kaposi's sarcoma\nEndemic African Kaposi's sarcoma is common in parts of Africa and is one of the most widespread types of cancer in that region.\nAlthough this type of Kaposi's sarcoma is classified separately from HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma, many cases may actually result from an undiagnosed HIV infection. All suspected cases therefore\u00a0must have an HIV test, as the most effective treatment in these cases is HIV medication.\nIn cases not caused by HIV infection, this type of Kaposi's sarcoma may be the result of a genetic vulnerability to HHV-8. These cases are usually treated with chemotherapy, although sometimes radiotherapy may be used.\nOutlook\nWith proper treatment, Kaposi's sarcoma can usually be controlled for many years. Deaths from the condition are uncommon in the UK.\nThe discoloured patches of skin will often shrink and fade with treatment, although they may not ever disappear completely.\nA complete cure for any type of Kaposi's sarcoma isn't always possible, and there's a chance the condition could recur in the future. If you think this is happening, contact your HIV clinic, hospital specialist or GP as soon as possible.\n"}, {"Name": "Kidney Cancer", "Information": "\nKidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in adults in the UK, with just over 10,100 people diagnosed each year.\nSigns and symptoms of kidney cancer can include:\n\nblood in your urine\u00a0\na constant pain in your side, just below the ribs\na lump or swelling in the kidney area (on either side of the body)\n\nSee your GP as soon as possible if you experience any of these symptoms. They will examine you and may refer you to a specialist clinic for further tests.\nIn around half of all cases of kidney cancer, there are no symptoms, and the condition is detected during tests for other unrelated conditions.\nRead more about the symptoms of kidney cancer\u00a0and diagnosing kidney cancer.\nThe kidneys and cancer\nThe kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just underneath the ribcage.\nTheir main role is to filter out waste products from the blood, in addition to producing urine. Only one of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer.\nThe human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.\nExactly what triggers this growth\u00a0is unknown; however, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such as\u00a0smoking and obesity.\nKidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men.\nRead more about the causes of kidney cancer.\nTypes of kidney cancer\nMany different types of cancer can affect the kidneys.

See the\u00a0Cancer Research UK website for more information about transitional cell cancer and Wilms\u2019 tumour.\nTreating kidney cancer\nThe earlier kidney cancer is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.\nHow it's treated will depend on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery to remove the cancerous cells is usually the first course of action.\nUnlike most other cancers,\u00a0chemotherapy isn't very effective at treating kidney cancer. However, non-surgical treatments are available, such as\u00a0radiotherapy or targeted therapies. These are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney.\nRead more about treating kidney cancer.\nPreventing kidney cancer\nAs the causes of kidney cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to fully prevent it.\nHowever, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. A combination of a\u00a0healthy diet and\u00a0regular exercise will help to avoid becoming overweight or obese, which is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.\nIf you're overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a calorie-controlled diet.\nRead more about treating obesity.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for kidney cancer is usually good if the condition is diagnosed in its early stages, when the cancer is still contained inside the kidney.\nKidney cancer can often be completely cured by removing some or all of the kidney. This is\u00a0because it's possible to live a healthy life with only one kidney. Around one in three cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed at an early stage.\nDepending on how aggressive the cancer is, 65-90% of people will live at least five years after receiving an early\u00a0diagnosis of kidney cancer, with many people living much longer.\nThe outlook for kidney cancer that's spread outside the kidney is less favourable. Around 40-70% of people with this stage of kidney cancer will live at least five years after receiving a diagnosis.\nIn cases where kidney cancer is advanced and has spread to other parts of the body, only around 10% of\u00a0people will live for at least five years after receiving a diagnosis.\n"}, {"Name": "Kidney Infection", "Information": "\nA kidney infection\u00a0(pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness\u00a0caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of\u00a0your kidneys.\nIt's more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful.\nIf treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn't cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn't treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage.\nSymptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.\nRead more about the symptoms of a kidney infection\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP\u00a0if you have a fever and persistent\u00a0tummy, lower back\u00a0or genital pain,\u00a0or if you notice a change\u00a0to your usual pattern of urination.\nMost kidney infections need\u00a0prompt treatment with\u00a0antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers.\nIf you're especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you\u00a0have a pre-existing health condition or are\u00a0pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital\u00a0and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip.\nAfter taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about two weeks.\nIn rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. These include blood poisoning (sepsis) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess.\nRead more about\u00a0treating a kidney infection\u00a0and the complications of a kidney infection\nWhat causes a kidney infection?\nA kidney infection usually happens when bacteria\u00a0\u2013\u00a0often a type called\u00a0E. coli\u00a0\u2013\u00a0gets into the\u00a0urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body)\u00a0and travels up through the bladder\u00a0and\u00a0into the kidneys.\nRead more about the causes of a kidney infection\nWho's at risk?\nKidney infections are relatively rare. It's estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK.\nThey can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman's urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.\nYounger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.\nYounger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys.\nCan kidney infections be prevented?\nYou can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation.\nRead more about preventing a\u00a0kidney infection\n"}, {"Name": "Kidney Stones", "Information": "\nKidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60.\nThey're\u00a0quite common, with around three in 20 men and up to two in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives.\nThe medical\u00a0term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if\u00a0they cause severe pain it's known as renal colic.\nSymptoms of kidney stones\nSmall kidney stones may\u00a0go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine.\u00a0But it's fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the:\n\nureter \u2013 the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder\nurethra \u2013 the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body\n\nA blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes a urinary tract infection\u00a0(UTI).\nRead more about the symptoms of kidney stones.\nWhat causes kidney stones?\nThe waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump.\nThis is more likely to happen if you don't drink enough fluids, if you're taking\u00a0some types of\u00a0medication,\u00a0or if you have\u00a0a medical condition\u00a0that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine.\nRead more about the causes of kidney stones.\nAfter a kidney stone has formed,\u00a0your body\u00a0will try to pass it\u00a0out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means\u00a0it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder).\nTreating and preventing kidney stones\nMost kidney stones\u00a0are small enough to be passed in your urine, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication.\nLarger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or\u00a0laser energy. Occasionally, keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly.\nRead more about treating kidney stones.\nIt's estimated that\u00a0up to\u00a0half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following five\u00a0years.\nTo avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day\u00a0so you don't become dehydrated.

You should also avoid driving, using tools and machinery, or working at heights if you're feeling dizzy.\nTreating labyrinthitis\nIn most cases, the symptoms pass within a few weeks. Treatment involves a combination of bed rest and medication to help you cope better with the symptoms. You may need additional medication to fight the underlying infection, although antibiotics are not often required as the cause is most commonly due to a virus.\nContact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.\nA small number of people have persistent symptoms that last for several months, or possibly years. This requires a more intensive type of treatment called vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).\nRead more about treating labyrinthitis\nThe labyrinth\nThe labyrinth is the innermost part of the ear. It contains two important parts:\n\nthe cochlea \u2013 this relays sounds to the brain and is responsible for hearing\nthe vestibular system \u2013 a complex set of fluid-filled channels that contributes to your sense of balance\n\nInflammation of the labyrinth can disrupt your hearing and sense of balance, triggering the symptoms of labyrinthitis. The labyrinth usually becomes inflamed either because of:\n\na viral infection, such as a cold or flu\na bacterial infection, which is much less common\n\nRead more about the causes of labyrinthitis\nWho gets labyrinthitis?\nMost cases of viral labyrinthitis occur in adults aged 30 to 60 years old. Viral labyrinthitis is relatively common in adults. Other types of ear infections are usually more widespread in children. Bacterial labyrinthitis is much less common. Younger children under two years old are more vulnerable to developing bacterial labyrinthitis.\nComplications of labyrinthitis\nBacterial labyrinthitis carries a higher risk of causing permanent hearing loss, particularly in children who have developed it as a complication of meningitis.\nBecause of this high risk, a hearing test is recommended following bacterial labyrinthitis.\nSevere hearing loss following bacterial labyrinthitis can sometimes be treated with a cochlear implant. This is not a conventional hearing aid, but a small electronic device fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery.\nRead more information about hearing loss\nVestibular neuronitis\nMany people diagnosed with labyrinthitis only experience the balance symptoms without hearing loss.\nThis is actually known as\u00a0vestibular neuronitis rather than labyrinthitis.\nHowever, both terms are often used to describe the same diagnosis.\n"}, {"Name": "Lactose Intolerance", "Information": "\nLactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products.\nSymptoms of lactose intolerance\u00a0usually develop within a few hours of consuming food\u00a0or drink that contains lactose. They may include:\n\nflatulence (wind)\ndiarrhoea\nbloated stomach\nstomach cramps and pains\nstomach rumbling\nfeeling sick\n\nThe severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you've consumed.\nSome people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nThe symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it's important to see your GP for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet.\nFor example, the symptoms above can also be caused by:\n\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\u00a0\u2013 a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system\nmilk protein intolerance \u2013 an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk allergy)\n\nIf your GP thinks\u00a0you\u00a0have lactose intolerance,\u00a0they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve.\nRead more about diagnosing lactose intolerance\nWhat causes lactose intolerance?\nThe body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream.\nPeople with\u00a0lactose intolerance\u00a0don't produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it's fermented by bacteria. This leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.\nDepending on the underlying reason why the body isn't producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks.\nRead more about the causes of lactose intolerance\nWho's affected?\nIn the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent.\nLactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected.\nIs it an allergy?\nLactose\u00a0intolerance isn't the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This\u00a0causes symptoms such as\u00a0a rash, wheezing and itching.\nIf you're allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person).\nTreating lactose intolerance\nThere's no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to\u00a0control the symptoms.\nDepending on what dairy products you're able to eat, you may also require additional\u00a0calcium\u00a0and\u00a0vitamin D\u00a0supplements to keep\u00a0your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice.\nIn addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes\u00a0may\u00a0also be helpful. These are\u00a0drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion\u00a0of lactose.\nRead more about treating lactose intolerance\nComplications of lactose intolerance\nMilk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and\u00a0vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These\u00a0vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones.\nIf you're lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and\u00a0put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions:\n\nOsteopenia \u2013\u00a0where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis \u2013 where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased.\nMalnutrition \u2013 when the food you eat doesn't give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you're malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed.\n\nIf you're concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements.\nYour GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The British Dietetic Association has information on how to find a private dietitian.\n"}, {"Name": "Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis", "Information": "\nThis information is about a condition called Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) in children. LCH is classified as a cancer and sometimes requires treatment with chemotherapy. About 50 children in the UK develop LCH each year. It can affect children of any age, and is more common in boys than in girls.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)\nLCH is an unusual condition. It has some characteristics of cancer but, unlike almost every other cancer, it may spontaneously resolve in some patients while being life-threatening in others. LCH is classified as a cancer and sometimes requires treatment with chemotherapy. LCH patients are therefore usually treated by children\u2019s cancer specialists (paediatric oncologists/ haematologists).\nLangerhans refers to Dr Paul Langerhans, who first described the cells in the skin which are similar to the cells found in LCH lesions.\nHistiocytosis refers to histiocytes which are cells that are part of the immune system, and are found in many parts of the body. There are two types of histiocytes:\n\nmacrophage/monocyte cells - these destroy harmful proteins, viruses and bacteria in the body\ndendritic cells - these stimulate the immune system\n\nLangerhans cells are dendritic cells and are normally only found in the skin and major airways. In LCH, the abnormal dendritic cells that look similar to Langerhans cells may be found in different parts of the body, including the bone marrow, skin, lungs, liver, lymph glands, spleen and pituitary gland. When these abnormal dendritic cells accumulate in these tissues, they may cause damage.\nLCH is divided into two groups:\n\nsingle-system LCH - when the disease affects only one part of the body, for example the skin or the bone\nmulti-system LCH - when it affects more than one part of the body\n\nCauses\nThe cause of LCH is unknown. It cannot be caught from other people and is not passed on in families.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe symptoms of LCH will depend on which part of the body is affected and whether the disease is affecting more than one part of the body. The lymph glands may be enlarged, and the child may be irritable and have a poor appetite. Pain in the bone and/or swelling and lumps on the skull can occur if LCH is affecting the bone. A skin rash such as cradle cap or nappy rash may occur if the skin is affected. A discharge from the ear or hearing problems can occur if the ear is affected. The child may have breathing difficulties if LCH affects the lungs or chest. Tummy problems such as diarrhoea and liver problems including jaundice can occur if LCH is within the abdomen.\nIn 10\u201320% of patients with multi-system disease, the pituitary gland at the base of the brain is affected, causing hormonal problems. This can lead to the child passing larger amounts of urine and being very thirsty. This is called diabetes insipidus, which is different from sugar diabetes and can be well-controlled with specific medicines. Occasionally, other pituitary hormones may be affected, causing poor growth or delayed puberty, which can also be treated.\nHow LCH is diagnosed\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose LCH. Tests are likely to include the removal of a sample of cells from an affected part of the body (a biopsy). This is usually done in an operation under a general anaesthetic. The cells are then examined under a microscope. X-rays are taken of the bones, the skull and the lungs. Blood and urine tests will also be done. Additional scans and tests may be required depending on which parts of your child\u2019s body is affected. These tests help the doctors decide whether the disease is a single-system or multi-system type.\nWhen your child is having the tests, they may need to stay in hospital. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nTreatment\nSingle-system LCH may disappear on its own without any treatment. In some children, treatment such as surgery and corticosteroids (such as prednisolone) may be used. Multi-system LCH is usually treated with chemotherapy and corticosteroids. The length of treatment varies from child to child.\nChemotherapy is an anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication that can destroy cancer cells, and corticosteroids are hormonal substances that are naturally produced in the body. Both chemotherapy and corticosteroids can help to destroy the LCH cells.\nSide effects of treatment\nChemotherapy and corticosteroids used to treat LCH may cause side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the particular treatment being used.\nSide effects of chemotherapy can include feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting, hair loss, an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding, and tiredness.\nSide effects of corticosteroids can include mood changes and an increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain. All of these side effects should get better when treatment stops.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Research has found that people receiving treatment within clinical trials tend to do as well as, or better than, similar patients treated outside clinical trials. This does not mean that trial treatments are always better. However, hospitals that carry out trials do have access to good equipment and, like all hospitals, they follow precise guidelines when giving treatment.\nMost treatment trials for LCH are set up and organised by The Histiocyte Society, a group of international specialists in histiocytosis. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you may have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given time to decide whether it\u2019s right for your child.\nFollow-up care\nIt is important to know that the vast majority of children will recover completely from LCH. Some children however, are left with persistent/recurring problems and for a very small number of patients with multi-system LCH, it can be a life-threatening condition. After successfully completing treatment, patients will have follow-up clinic appointments. LCH sometimes comes back (\u2018reactivates\u2019) and may need treatment again. If this happens, treatments for LCH that have worked for them before may be effective again. The same or different treatment may then be required. Patients are also monitored for possible permanent consequences of the disease (e.g. a low production of certain hormones, hearing problems, lung problems) and may need treatment for these conditions.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s specialist medical team who know the situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Laryngeal Larynx Cancer", "Information": "\nLaryngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the larynx (voice box).\nThe larynx is part of the throat found at the entrance of the windpipe (trachea).

They may also ask if you have other symptoms, such as numbness or swelling, which may be a sign that you have secondary leg cramps caused by an underlying condition.\nIn this case,\u00a0you may need further tests, such as blood tests and urine tests, to rule out other conditions.\nTreating leg cramps\nMost cases of leg cramps can be relieved by exercising the affected muscles. Exercising your legs during the day will often help reduce how often you get cramping episodes.\nStretches\nTo stretch your calf muscles, stand with the front half of your feet on a step, with your heels hanging off the edge. Slowly lower your heels so that they are below the level of the step. Hold for a few seconds before lifting your heels back up to the starting position. Repeat a number of times.\nMedication is usually only needed in the most persistent cases where cramping does not respond to exercise.\nIf you have secondary leg cramps, treating the underlying cause may help relieve your symptoms.\nLeg cramps that occur during pregnancy should pass after the baby is born.\nTreating cramps that occur as a result of serious liver disease can be more difficult. Your treatment plan may include using medications such as muscle relaxants.\nRead more about treating leg cramps\nPreventing leg cramps\nIf you often get leg cramps, regularly stretching the muscles in your lower legs may help prevent the cramps or reduce their frequency.\nYou might find it useful to stretch your calves before you go to bed each night (see stretching advice above or try this post-exercise calf stretch).\nThe following night-time advice\u00a0may also help:\n\nIf you lie on your back, make sure that your toes point upwards \u2013 placing a pillow on its side at the end of your bed, with the soles of your feet propped up against it may help keep your feet in the right position.\u00a0\nIf you lie on your front, hang your feet over the end of the bed \u2013 this will keep your feet in a relaxed position and help stop the muscles in your calves from contracting and tensing.\nKeep your sheets and blankets loose.\n\n"}, {"Name": "Lichen Planus", "Information": "\nLichen planus is a non-infectious, itchy rash that can affect many areas of the body.\nAffected areas can\u00a0include the:\n\narms, legs and trunk\u00a0\nmouth (oral lichen planus)\nnails and scalp\nvulva, vagina and penis\n\nRead more about the symptoms of lichen planus.\nThe exact cause of lichen planus is unknown.

However, the chances of developing the condition are high for people with risk factors for the condition.\nThe number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. Around two in every three cases affect men.\nOver the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity.\u00a0\nDiagnosis and screening\nLiver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a GP and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver.\nHowever, regular check-ups for liver cancer (known as surveillance) are often recommended for people known to have a high risk of developing the condition, such as those with cirrhosis.\nHaving regular check-ups helps ensure the condition is diagnosed early. The earlier\u00a0liver cancer is diagnosed, the more effective\u00a0treatment is likely to be.\nRead\u00a0more about diagnosing liver cancer.\nHow liver cancer is treated\nTreatment for liver cancer depends on the stage the condition is at.

Boys are affected more commonly than girls. Liver tumours can be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). This factsheet is about malignant liver tumours.\nThere are two main types of primary liver cancer:\nHepatoblastoma\nThis usually occurs in children under five years of age. About eight children in the UK are diagnosed with hepatoblastoma each year.\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)\nThis is rarer and usually occurs in older children. About two children in the UK are diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma each year.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nThe liver\nThe liver is the largest organ in the body. It is surrounded by a fibrous capsule and is divided into sections called lobes. It lies across the upper part of the abdomen and is larger on the right-hand side of the body than on the left. It\u2019s surrounded, and protected from injury, by the lower ribs.\nThe liver is an extremely important organ that has many functions. One of these functions is to produce proteins that circulate in the blood. Some of the proteins help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Others are essential for maintaining the balance of fluid in the body. The liver also destroys harmful substances. It breaks down waste products not used by the body so that they can be passed out in the urine or stools (bowel motions).\nThe liver is responsible for breaking down food containing carbohydrates (sugars) and fats, so they can be used by the body for energy. It stores substances such as glucose and vitamins so that they can be used by the body when needed.\nThe liver also produces bile, a substance that breaks down the fats in food so that they can be absorbed from the bowel (intestine).\nThe liver is connected to the small intestine (duodenum) by a tube called the bile duct. This duct takes the bile produced by the liver to the intestine.\nThe liver has an amazing ability to repair itself. It can function normally even if only a small part of it is working.\nCauses\nThe cause of most primary liver tumours in the western world is unknown. However, in other parts of the world, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is commonly related to the presence of liver infection. This happens in countries where mothers commonly have hepatitis B and vaccination is not readily available at birth for their children.\nChildren who are infected with hepatitis B have a higher risk of developing HCC in late childhood than uninfected children.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe most common symptom is a lump or swelling in the abdomen, which can be painful. Other possible symptoms include weight loss, a loss of appetite, feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting).\nHow liver tumours are diagnosed\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a liver tumour.\nAn ultrasound scan and X-rays will be taken, which can show if there is a tumour in the liver. Further tests, including CT (computerised tomography) scans or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, will be done to find out the extent of the disease, both inside and outside the liver. Blood tests will also be carried out.\nMost hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas produce a protein that is released into the bloodstream. This protein is known as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). It\u2019s possible to measure levels of AFP in the blood, which can be a useful indicator of whether the liver tumour is responding to treatment or whether it may have come back after treatment. AFP is also known as a tumour marker.\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nGrouping\nTo assess the extent of the cancer, a grouping system called PRETEXT (pre-treatment extent of disease) is used. It uses an MRI scan to measure the amount of cancer in the liver at diagnosis. It\u2019s also used to help establish the best treatment for each child.\nThis grouping system is unique to liver tumours and is increasingly used all over the world.\nThis grouping process is essential because liver tumours need to be removed surgically. Grouping divides the liver into four surgical areas (sectors) and gives an indication of the kind of surgery that is needed to remove the tumour. Grouping also helps doctors decide whether a liver transplant surgeon needs to be involved from the start or not.\nPRETEXT 1\nOne liver sector is affected and the tumour can be removed by straightforward surgery.\nPRETEXT 2\nTwo adjoining sectors are affected and the tumour can be removed with more extensive surgery.\nPRETEXT 3\nTwo or three sectors are affected with no two adjoining sectors free of disease, and the tumour can be removed with major surgery.\nPRETEXT 4\nAll four sectors of the liver are affected, and the tumour cannot be removed without replacing the liver with a donor liver transplant.\nDoctors also look at the extent of the spread of cancer beyond the liver:\nIn the blood vessels\nSometimes the tumour gets into the blood vessels that are entering or leaving the liver. This may affect the type of surgery needed to remove the tumour.\nIn the abdomen\nSometimes the tumour spreads outside the liver and into the abdomen (tummy). The tumour cannot be removed completely.\nIn the lungs or other organs\nIf the tumour spreads outside the liver through the bloodstream (metastatic disease), it usually goes to the lungs. About 1 in 5 children are found to have affected lungs when they are diagnosed. Doctors use X-rays and CT or MRI scans to assess whether the lungs are affected.\nTreatment\nThe diagnosis is made by taking a sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). This is done under a general anaesthetic. Once the diagnosis and staging have been confirmed, plans for treatment will be made.\nHepatoblastoma\nFor hepatoblastoma, the type of treatment will depend on the PRETEXT staging and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease).\nPRETEXT 1, 2 and 3 tumours are called \u2018standard risk\u2019. PRETEXT 4 is called \u2018high risk\u2019 and includes tumours that have spread to other parts of the body.\nTreatment is broadly similar for all PRETEXT stages. Chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) is given first. The aim of chemotherapy is to shrink the tumour in the liver and hopefully get rid of any metastatic tumours. Surgery to remove any of the\u00a0remaining tumour will take place after a few weeks of chemotherapy. Further chemotherapy is usually given after surgery. Your child\u2019s doctor will give you more detailed information about the chemotherapy drugs and their side effects.\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nFor hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment is a little different.\nThe role of chemotherapy is less certain and surgery is the main treatment. Doctors usually recommend removing the tumour (if it\u2019s small enough) at diagnosis. Chemotherapy may be given afterwards. However in many situations the tumour is too large to remove at first, and so chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumour so that surgery can be done later.\nHepatocellular tumours don\u2019t always respond to chemotherapy as well as hepatoblastomas. For this reason, other treatments, such as chemoembolisation and targeted treatments (see below), may be used.\nChemoembolisation\nThis refers to the giving of drugs directly into the artery going into the liver. Very occasionally, this may be used for hepatocellular cancer.\nTargeted drugs\nTargeted drugs are a group of treatments that work in a different way to conventional chemotherapy. Some drugs may cause cancer cells to die directly. Others act to cut off the blood supply to the tumour cells (antiangiogenesis drugs). Some drugs, called multi-targeted agents, work in both ways.\nResearch is looking into how useful targeted treatments are on their own and in combination with chemotherapy. Your child\u2019s doctor may talk to you more about this research.\nSurgery\nAll children, if they are able to, will have surgery following chemotherapy. If there\u2019s cancer in the lungs, which hasn\u2019t completely disappeared with the chemotherapy, the lungs will be operated on first. If the liver tumour can be surgically removed, the operation to do so will follow, usually a week or two later.\nIf the tumour involves all four sectors of the liver (PRETEXT 4), a liver transplant will be necessary. This is recommended for hepatoblastoma but only in particular circumstances for hepatocellular carcinoma. In a transplant, the whole liver is removed and replaced with a liver from another person.\nThis will be discussed with you from the beginning, and you will be given the opportunity to think about donating half of your liver, or for your child to have a liver from a donor. The transplant team will be there to answer all of your questions. A liver transplant is only possible if all the cancer outside the liver has gone.\nSide effects of treatment\nTreatment often causes side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. Side effects can include:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\nhair loss\nan increased risk of infection\nbruising and bleeding\ntiredness\ndiarrhoea\n\nLate side effects\nThe chemotherapy used to treat liver cancer can cause late side effects. These may include hearing problems, kidney problems and possibly heart problems. There will be a slightly increased risk of your child developing another type of cancer later in life. Most children will develop some late effects and need to have some follow-up tests. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects.\nRecurrence\nIf the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as a recurrence. It can come back in the liver or in other parts of the body. If the cancer comes back, often (before anything is seen on scans) the levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the child\u2019s blood will start to rise again and reaches levels of over 100. Small rises in AFP can occur in the weeks after surgery, as the liver regenerates as much as it can.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancer. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nWhen the treatment ends, your child will have regular blood tests to measure the level of AFP in the blood (if appropriate), as well as scans and chest X-rays. More than three quarters of children with hepatoblastoma are cured, and for children with small tumours that are confined to the liver, the outlook is even better. The outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma is not quite as good. The staff at the hospital can give you information about the likely outcome for your child.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Loss Of Libido", "Information": "\nLoss of libido (sex drive) is a common problem affecting up to one in five men \u2013 and even more women \u2013 at some point in their life.\nIt's often linked to professional and personal stress, or\u00a0important life-changing events such as pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.\nHowever, an unexpected loss of libido\u00a0\u2013\u00a0especially when it lasts for a long time or keeps returning\u00a0\u2013\u00a0can also indicate an underlying personal, medical or lifestyle problem,\u00a0which can be upsetting to both partners in a relationship.\nIf you're concerned about your libido, especially if your diminished sex drive distresses you or affects your relationship, make an appointment to see your GP to discuss any underlying causes and possible medical or psychological treatments.\nDoctors at your nearest family planning clinic, Integrated Sexual Health clinic, or Contraceptive and Sexual Health (CASH) clinic may also be able to help.\nIn the meantime, you may find the following information useful. It explains some of the most common reasons for loss of libido.\nRelationship problems\nThe first thing you should consider is whether you're happy in your relationship. Do you have any doubts or worries that may be the real reason for your loss of sexual desire?\nIf you've been in a relationship for a long time, you may have become overfamiliar with your partner and feel a degree of erotic dissatisfaction. This is quite common and can have a negative effect on your sex drive.\nRelationship problems are among the most common causes of loss of libido. For help and advice, you\u00a0may find it useful to contact the relationship support charity Relationships Scotland.\nAnother thing to consider is whether the problem is a performance issue that makes sex difficult or unfulfilling. For example, many men experience ejaculation problems or erectile dysfunction, and women can experience painful sex or vaginismus (when the muscles around the vagina tighten involuntarily before penetration). See your GP if these problems are an issue, as they're often treatable.\nYour GP may feel you will benefit from psychosexual counselling. This is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your loss of libido.\u00a0\nStress, anxiety and exhaustion\nStress, anxiety and exhaustion can be all-consuming and have a major impact on your happiness. If you feel you're constantly tired, stressed or anxious, you may need to make some lifestyle changes or speak to your GP for advice.\nFor more information and advice read about\u00a0beating stress at work\u00a0and\u00a010 stress busters\nDepression\nDepression\u00a0is very different from simply feeling unhappy, miserable or fed up for a short while. It's a serious illness where you may have feelings of extreme sadness that can last for a long time. These feelings are severe enough to interfere with your daily life, including your sex life.\nYou're probably depressed if you're feeling low or hopeless, or you've lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy. In this case it's really important to see your GP. They may feel you'll benefit from antidepressants.\nHowever, low sex drive can also be a side effect of many antidepressants. Speak to your GP if you're already taking antidepressants and think they may be causing your problems, as you may be able to switch to a different medication.\nDrugs and alcohol\nDrinking excess amounts of alcohol can reduce your sex drive, so it's a good idea to moderate your intake to no more than three to four units a day if you're a man, and no more than two to three units a day if you're a woman.\nRead more about alcohol misuse and find out how to get support for a drinking problem.\nDrug misuse is also linked to a loss of sex drive. Read more about drugs for information and advice.\nGetting older\nMany people lose some interest in sex as they get older, mainly as a result of falling levels of sex hormones, age-related health problems, or the side effects of medication.\nOlder men especially can develop low testosterone levels, which can cause fatigue, depression and a reduced sex drive.\nSpeak to your GP if you're concerned about this. They may carry out a blood test to check your testosterone level and can tell you about treatments if your level is low.\nAs women start to approach the menopause, levels of the female hormone oestrogen begin to fall, which can affect libido. Women can also suffer from low testosterone levels, especially after a hysterectomy. Testosterone is another hormone\u00a0that can affect sex drive.\nSpeak to your GP if you're concerned the menopause may be having an effect on your libido. They may be able to offer you a trial of hormone replacement therapy\u00a0(HRT) if it's suitable for you.\nHormonal problems\nLess commonly, low libido may be caused by an underactive thyroid. This is where your thyroid gland (located in the neck) doesn't produce enough hormones. Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.\nAn underactive thyroid is easily treated by taking hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. Learn more about treating underactive thyroid.\nA hormonal problem called hyperprolactinaemia can also have a negative effect on your sex drive. This is where you have a raised level of a substance called prolactin in your blood.\nContraception\nSome women have reported a decreased sex drive while using\u00a0some types of hormonal\u00a0contraception, such as:\n\ncombined contraception, including the\u00a0combined pill, vaginal ring,\u00a0or contraceptive patch\nthe progestogen-only pill\nthe contraceptive implant\nthe Depo-Provera injection\n\nHowever, side effects of these contraceptives\u00a0tend to\u00a0improve within a few months and they're generally well tolerated.\nSpeak to your GP or\u00a0local contraceptive (or family planning) clinic if you're worried\u00a0your contraception\u00a0is causing a loss of libido. They may suggest trying an alternative method.\nRead more about choosing a method of contraception\nOther medical conditions\nLong-term (chronic) medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity can also have a negative effect on your libido.\nMedication\nCertain medications can sometimes reduce libido, such as:\n\nmedication for high blood pressure, including diuretics\nmedications for depression, including SSRI antidepressants\nmedications for seizures (fits)\nmedications commonly used to treat\u00a0psychosis (a mental condition where a person can't distinguish between reality and their imagination), such as haloperidol, as well as many other conditions\nmedicines such as cimetidine, finasteride and cyproterone, which block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone\n\nSee your GP if you're worried that medication you're taking is responsible for your reduced sex drive. They can review your medication and switch your prescription to something less likely to affect your libido if necessary.\n"}, {"Name": "Lung Cancer", "Information": "\nLung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer.

This means the outlook for the condition isn't as good as many\u00a0other types of cancer.\nOverall, about 1 in 3 people with the condition live for at least a year after they're diagnosed and\u00a0about 1 in\u00a020 people live at least\u00a010 years.\nHowever, survival rates can vary widely, depending on how far the cancer has spread at the time of diagnosis.\u00a0Early diagnosis can make a big difference.\nRead about living with lung cancer\n"}, {"Name": "Lupus", "Information": "\nLupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening.\nTypes of lupus\nThere are some types of lupus that just affect the skin \u2013 such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects.\nHowever, the term \"lupus\" is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs.\nSymptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe.\nEven mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person\u2019s quality of life.\nThe rest of this article will focus on SLE.\nSigns and symptoms\nSLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are:\n\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nrashes \u2013 particularly on the face, wrists and hands\njoint pain\u00a0and swelling\n\nAs the\u00a0symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose.\nIf you\u00a0have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE, you should see your GP so they can try to determine the cause.\nRead more about the symptoms of lupus\u00a0and diagnosing lupus.\u00a0\nWhat causes lupus?\nSLE\u00a0is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs.\nAs with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors\u00a0may be\u00a0responsible for triggering\u00a0SLE in certain people.\nRead more\u00a0about the causes of lupus.\nWho is affected\nSLE is an uncommon condition where around 90% of cases occur in women. The condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages.\nThe condition tends to be less common in people of white European origin and more common in those of African, Caribbean or Asian origin.\nHow\u00a0lupus is treated\nThere is currently no cure for SLE, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and reduce the chances of organ damage.\nThese medications include:\n\nhydroxychloroquine \u2013 a medicine that has historically been used to treat\u00a0malaria, but can also help treat some symptoms of SLE\ncorticosteroids \u2013 anti-inflammatory medications\nimmunosuppressants \u2013 a group of medicines that suppress your immune system\n\nWith good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with SLE are able to manage their condition effectively.\nRead more\u00a0about treating lupus.\nOutlook\nA few decades ago SLE was regarded as a terminal condition, as many people would die of an associated complication within a few years of being diagnosed.\nAs a result of early diagnosis and advances in treatment, however, the outlook for SLE is now much better. The vast majority of people diagnosed with the condition will have a normal or near-normal life expectancy.\nHowever, some people with SLE are still at risk of life-threatening complications as a result of damage to internal organs and tissues, such as heart attack\u00a0or\u00a0stroke. SLE, and some of the treatments for it, can also increase your risk of developing potentially serious infections.\nRead more about the complications of lupus.\n"}, {"Name": "Lyme Disease", "Information": "\nLyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks.\nTicks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and heath areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease are found throughout the UK and in other parts of\u00a0Europe and North America.\nLyme disease\u00a0can often be treated effectively if it's detected early on. But if it's not treated or treatment is delayed, there's a risk you could develop severe and long-lasting symptoms.\nThis page covers:\nSigns and symptoms of Lyme disease\nWhen to see your GP\nHow you get Lyme disease\nWho's at risk and where are ticks found?\nTreating Lyme disease\nPreventing Lyme disease\nHow to remove a tick\nChronic Lyme disease\nSigns and symptoms of Lyme disease\nEarly symptoms\nMany people with\u00a0early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around\u00a0three to 30 days after being bitten. This is known as erythema migrans.\nThe rash is often described as looking like a bull's-eye on a dart board. The affected area of skin will be red and the edges may feel slightly raised.\nThe size of the rash can\u00a0vary significantly and it may expand over several days or weeks. Typically it's\u00a0around 15cm (6 inches) across, but it can be much larger or smaller than this. Some people may develop several rashes in different parts of their body.\nHowever,\u00a0around one in three people with Lyme disease won't develop this rash.\nSome people with Lyme disease also experience\u00a0flu-like symptoms in the early stages, such as tiredness (fatigue), muscle pain, joint pain, headaches, a high temperature (fever), chills and neck stiffness.\nLater symptoms\nMore serious symptoms may develop several weeks, months or even years later if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early on. These\u00a0can include:\n\npain and swelling in the joints (inflammatory arthritis)\nproblems affecting the nervous system \u2013 such as\u00a0numbness and pain in your limbs, paralysis of your facial muscles, memory problems and difficulty concentrating\nheart problems \u2013 such as\u00a0inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or sac surrounding the heart (pericarditis), heart block\u00a0and\u00a0heart failure\ninflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) \u2013 which can cause\u00a0a severe headache, a stiff neck and increased sensitivity to light\n\nSome of these\u00a0problems will get better slowly with treatment, although they can persist if treatment is started late.\nA few people with Lyme disease go on to develop\u00a0long-term symptoms similar to those of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome.\u00a0This is known as post-infectious Lyme disease. It's not clear exactly why this happens, but it's likely to be related to overactivity of your immune system rather than persistent infection.\nWhen to see your GP\nYou should see your GP if you develop any of the symptoms described above after being bitten by a tick, or if you think you may have been bitten. Make sure you let your GP know if you've spent time in woodland or heath areas where ticks are known to live.\nDiagnosing Lyme disease is often difficult as many of the symptoms are similar to other conditions. A spreading rash some days after a known tick bite should be treated with appropriate antibiotics without waiting for the results of a blood test.\nBlood tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis after a few weeks, but these can be negative in the early stages of the infection. You may need to be re-tested if Lyme disease is still suspected after a negative test result.\nIn the UK, two types of blood test are used to ensure Lyme disease is diagnosed accurately. This is because a single blood test can sometimes produce a positive result even when a person doesn't have the infection.\nIf you have post-infectious Lyme disease or long-lasting symptoms, you may see a specialist in microbiology or infectious diseases. They can arrange\u00a0for blood samples to be sent to the national reference laboratory run by Public Health England (PHE), where further tests for other tick-borne infections can be carried out.\nHow you get Lyme disease\nIf a tick bites an animal carrying the bacteria\u00a0that cause Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), the tick\u00a0can also become infected. The tick can then transfer the bacteria to a human by biting them.\nTicks can be found in any areas with deep or overgrown vegetation where they have access to animals to feed on.\nThey're common in woodland and heath areas, but can also be found in gardens or parks.\nTicks\u00a0don't jump or fly, but climb on to your clothes or skin if you brush against something they're on. They then bite into the skin and start to feed on your blood.\nGenerally, you're more likely to become infected\u00a0if the tick remains attached to your skin for more than\u00a024 hours. But ticks are very small and their bites are not painful, so you may not realise you have one attached to your skin.\nWho's at risk and where are ticks found?\nPeople who spend time in woodland or heath areas in the UK and parts of Europe or North America are most at risk of developing Lyme disease.\nMost tick bites happen in late spring, early summer and autumn because these are the times of year when most people take part in outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping.\nCases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but the Scottish highlands is known to have a particularly high population of ticks.\nIt's thought only a small proportion of ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, so being bitten doesn't mean you'll definitely be infected. However, it's important to be aware of the risk and seek medical advice if you start to feel unwell.\n"}, {"Name": "Lymphoedema", "Information": "\nLymphoedema is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues.

It's usually linked to asbestos exposure.\nMesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles.\nMore than 2,600 people are diagnosed with the condition each year in the UK. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 60-80 and men are affected more commonly than women.\nUnfortunately, it's rarely possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms.\nSymptoms of mesothelioma\nThe symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don't appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos.\nSymptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs\u00a0include:\n\nchest pain\nshortness of breath\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\na high temperature (fever) and sweating, particularly at night\na persistent\u00a0cough\nloss of appetite and unexplained weight loss\nclubbed (swollen) fingertips\n\nSymptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy\u00a0include:\n\ntummy pain\u00a0or swelling\nfeeling or being sick\nloss of appetite and unexplained weight loss\ndiarrhoea\u00a0or constipation\n\nSee your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. Tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past.\nWhat causes mesothelioma?\nMesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a\u00a0group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that\u00a0used to be widely used in construction.\nThese tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the\u00a0lungs\u00a0over time.\u00a0It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma\u00a0typically developing more than\u00a020 years\u00a0after exposure to asbestos.\nThe use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However,\u00a0materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.\nRead more about asbestos and people at risk of exposure\u00a0and avoiding exposure to asbestos.\nHow mesothelioma is diagnosed\nIf your GP suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests.\nA\u00a0number of different tests may need to be carried out, including:\n\nan X-ray\u00a0of your chest or tummy\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 a number of X-ray images are taken to\u00a0create a detailed image of the inside of the body\nfluid drainage \u2013 if there's a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed\na thoracoscopy or laparoscopy \u2013 the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that's inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or anaesthetic; a sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed so it can be analysed\n\nThese tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread.\nTreatments for mesothelioma\nThe best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.\nAs mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible.\u00a0This is known as\u00a0palliative or supportive care.\nPossible treatments include:\n\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer\nradiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 this involves using\u00a0high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control\nsurgery \u2013\u00a0an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it's not clear whether surgery is helpful\n\nYou'll also\u00a0probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help\u00a0relieve\u00a0your pain.\nSometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back again by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you.\nOutlook for mesothelioma\nUnfortunately the outlook for mesothelioma tends to be poor. This is because it doesn't usually cause any obvious symptoms until late on and it can progress quite quickly once it reaches this stage.\nOverall:\n\naround half (50%) of people with mesothelioma will live at least a year after diagnosis\naround one in every 10 people (10%)\u00a0with mesothelioma will live at least\u00a0five years after diagnosis\n\nThere are\u00a0currently around 2,500 deaths from mesothelioma each year in the UK.\n"}, {"Name": "Middle Ear Infection Otitis Media", "Information": "\nOtitis media is an infection of the middle ear that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) and a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum.\nAnyone can develop a middle ear infection but infants between six and 15 months old are most commonly affected.\nIt's estimated that around one in every four children experience at least one middle ear infection by the time they're 10 years old.\nSymptoms of a middle ear infection\nIn most cases, the symptoms of a middle ear infection (otitis media) develop quickly and resolve in a few days.

This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting.\nMotor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), occurs when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord called motor neurones stop working properly. This is known as neurodegeneration.\nMotor neurones control important muscle activity, such as:\n\ngripping\nwalking\nspeaking\nswallowing\nbreathing\n\nAs the condition progresses, people with motor neurone disease will find some or all of these activities increasingly difficult. Eventually, they may become impossible.\nIt's not clear what causes motor neurones to stop working properly. In about 5% of cases there's a family history of either motor neurone disease or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia. This is known as familial motor neurone disease. In most of these cases, faulty genes have been identified as making a major contribution to the development of the condition.\nThere's no single test to diagnose motor neurone disease and diagnosis is based mainly on the opinion of a brain and nervous system\u00a0specialist (a neurologist). The diagnosis of motor neurone disease is usually clear to an experienced neurologist, but sometimes specialised tests are needed to rule out other conditions with similar features.\nRead more about the causes of motor neurone disease and diagnosing motor neurone disease\nProgression of symptoms\nThe symptoms of motor neurone disease begin gradually over weeks and months, usually on one side of the body initially, and get progressively worse. Common early symptoms include:\n\na weakened grip, which can cause difficulty picking up or holding objects\nweakness at the shoulder that makes lifting the arm difficult\na \"foot drop\" caused by weak ankle muscles\ndragging of the leg\nslurred speech (dysarthria)\n\nThe condition isn't usually painful.\nAs damage progresses, symptoms spread to other parts of the body and the condition becomes more debilitating.\nEventually, a person with motor neurone disease may be unable to move. Communicating, swallowing and breathing may also become very difficult.\nIn up to 15% of cases, motor neurone disease is associated with a type of dementia that can affect personality and behaviour. This is called frontotemporal dementia,\u00a0and is often an early feature when it occurs in motor neurone disease. The affected person may not realise that their personality or behaviour is different.\nWho's affected by motor neurone disease?\nMotor neurone disease is a rare condition that affects around two in every 100,000 people in the UK each year. There are about 5,000 people living with the condition in the UK at any one time.\nThe condition can affect adults of all ages, including teenagers, although this is extremely rare. It's usually diagnosed in people over 40, but most people with the condition first develop symptoms in their 60s. It affects slightly more men than women.\nTreating motor neurone disease\nThere's currently no cure for motor neurone disease. Treatment aims to:\n\nmake the person feel comfortable and have the best quality of life possible\ncompensate for the progressive loss of bodily functions such as mobility, communication, swallowing and breathing\n\nFor example, a breathing mask can greatly help the symptoms of breathing and weakness, and a feeding tube (called a gastrostomy) helps maintain nutrition and overall comfort.\u00a0If necessary, medication can be used to help control excessive drooling.\nA medication called riluzole has shown a very small improvement in patients' overall survival, but it isn't a cure and doesn't stop the condition progressing.\nRead more about treating motor neurone disease\nSurvival rates\nMotor neurone disease is a severely life-shortening condition for most people. Life expectancy for about half of those with the condition is three years from the start of symptoms. However, some people may live for up to 10 years, and in rarer circumstances even longer.\nLiving with motor neurone disease is extremely challenging and often a terrifying possibility before the diagnosis is made. However,\u00a0it's not necessarily as bleak as people imagine.\nWith strong community and specialist support, many people can maintain some independence for a significant part of the condition's course, and experience a quality of life they may not have imagined was possible at the time of their diagnosis.\nThe end of life for someone with motor neurone disease isn't usually distressing and is most often in their own home. In most cases, a person with the condition will die in their sleep\u00a0as the end stage of gradual weakness in their breathing muscles. Although some people with the condition will\u00a0have swallowing problems, they won't choke to death.\nAdvice and support\nThe Motor Neurone Disease Scotland\u00a0is the leading Scottish charity for people affected by the condition.\nMND Scotland can give you information, practical advice and support about living with motor neurone disease and coping with the emotional impact of being diagnosed.\nInformation about you\nIf you have\u00a0motor neurone disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

This is thought to be due to the fact that, on average, men drink more alcohol than women.\nTreating mouth cancer\nThere are three main treatment options for mouth cancer. They are:\n\nsurgery \u2013 where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue\nchemotherapy \u2013 where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells\nradiotherapy \u2013 where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells\n\nThese treatments are often used in combination. For example, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.\nRead more about treating mouth cancer\nComplications of mouth cancer\nBoth surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult (dysphagia).\nDysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. If small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia.\nRead more about the complications of mouth cancer\nReducing the risk\nThe three most effective ways to prevent mouth cancer from developing \u2013 or prevent it reocurring after successful treatment \u2013 are:\n\nnot smoking\nkeeping to the recommended weekly limits for alcohol consumption (21 units for men and 14 units for women (read more about alcohol units)\neating a 'Mediterranean-style diet', with plenty of fresh vegetables (particularly tomatoes), citrus fruits, olive oil and fish (read more about healthy eating)\n\nIt's also important that you have regular dental check-ups because dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer.\nOutlook\nIf mouth cancer is diagnosed early, a complete cure is often possible using a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery.\nThe outlook for mouth cancer can vary depending on which part of the mouth is affected and whether it has spread from the mouth into surrounding tissue. The outlook is much better if the cancer is diagnosed early.\nOverall, an estimated 40% of people with cancer affecting the mouth and pharynx will live at least five years after their diagnosis and many people live much longer. However, the outlook is better for cancer affecting certain areas of the mouth, such as the lip, tongue or oral cavity.\n"}, {"Name": "Mouth Ulcer", "Information": "\nMouth ulcers are painful sores that appear in the mouth.

It produces the body's blood cells. Multiple myeloma\u00a0affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow.\nMyeloma does not\u00a0usually take the form of\u00a0a lump or tumour. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells.\nMyeloma\u00a0often\u00a0affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs.\nSigns and symptoms\nIn the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms.

In many cases, it\u2019s possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.\nIt's estimated that there are more than 100,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK.\nIt's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It's about two to three times more common in women than men.\nSymptoms of MS\nThe symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.\nThe main symptoms include:\n\nfatigue\ndifficulty walking\nvision problems, such as blurred vision\nproblems controlling the bladder\nnumbness or tingling in different parts of the body\nmuscle stiffness and spasms\nproblems with balance and co-ordination\nproblems with thinking, learning and planning\n\nDepending on the type of MS you have (see below), your symptoms may come and go in phases, or get steadily worse over time (progress).\nRead more about the symptoms of MS\nGetting medical advice\nSee your GP if you're worried you might have early signs of MS.\nThe early symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS. Let your GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you\u2019re experiencing.\nIf you GP thinks you could have MS, you'll be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system), who may suggest tests such as a\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to check for features of MS.\nRead more about diagnosing MS\nTypes of MS\nMS starts in one of two general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.\nRelapsing-remitting MS\nMore than 8 out of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the \"relapsing remitting\" type.\nSomeone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as \"relapses\". These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.\nRelapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.\nThe symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms\u00a0often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.\nPeriods between attacks are known as periods of \"remission\". These can last for years at a time.\nAfter many years (usually decades), many, but not all people, with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS. In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.\nAround half of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS within 15-20 years, and the risk of this happening increases the longer you have the condition.\nPrimary progressive MS\nJust over 1 in 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.\nIn primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.\nWhat causes MS?\nMS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body \u2013 in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.\nIn MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves, called the myelin sheath. This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.\nExactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of MS\nTreatments for MS\nThere's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition.\nThe treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties\u00a0you have. It may include:\n\ntreating relapses with short courses of\u00a0steroid medication to speed up recovery\nspecific treatments for\u00a0individual MS symptoms\ntreatment to reduce the number of relapses with medicines called disease-modifying therapies\n\nDisease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability of MS in people with relapsing remitting MS, and in people with secondary progressive MS who are still having relapses.\nUnfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS or secondary progressive MS in the absence of relapses. Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.\nRead more about how MS is treated\u00a0and living with MS\nOutlook\nMS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.\nMS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.\nThe average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average,\u00a0and\u00a0this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.\n"}, {"Name": "Mumps", "Information": "\nMumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine.\nIt\u2019s most recognisable by the painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive \"hamster face\" appearance.\nOther\u00a0symptoms of mumps\u00a0include headaches, joint pain and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands.\nWhen to see your GP\nIt's important to contact your GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made.\u00a0While\u00a0mumps isn't usually serious,\u00a0the condition\u00a0has similar symptoms to\u00a0more serious types of infection, such as\u00a0glandular fever and tonsillitis.\nYour GP can usually make a diagnosis\u00a0after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth\u00a0and checking the person's temperature to see if it's higher than normal.\nLet your GP know in advance if you're coming to the surgery, so they\u00a0can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection.\nIf your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection unit (HPU).

This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light.\nIf your GP thinks further tests are necessary, they'll refer you to hospital. At hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for nasopharyngeal cancer and rule out other conditions.\nSome of the tests you may have include:\n\na nasendoscopy \u2013\u00a0where a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope)\u00a0is inserted up your nose and passed down your throat to look for any abnormalities; it's carried out while you're awake, but local anaesthetic can be used to numb your nose and throat\nimaging scans \u2013\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computerised tomography (CT) scans can be used to check for tumours and determine whether the cancer has spread\na panendoscopy \u2013\u00a0a more detailed examination of your nose and throat carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) using a series of small, rigid telescopes connected together\na biopsy \u2013\u00a0where a small tissue sample is removed during a panendoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory\n\nOnce these tests are complete, your doctors will be able to confirm whether you have nasopharyngeal cancer. They'll also be able to \"stage\" the cancer, which means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer.\nHow nasopharyngeal cancer is treated\nIf you're diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you'll be cared for by a team of different specialists who work together called a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Members of your MDT will discuss with you what they think the best treatment option is in your case.\nThe two main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are:\n\nradiotherapy \u2013 where\u00a0radiation\u00a0is used to kill cancer cells\nchemotherapy \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells\n\nIn most cases, a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be used.\nSurgery isn't usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer as it's difficult for surgeons to access the affected area.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers.\nIn most cases, external radiotherapy is used. This involves using a machine to focus high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment.\nIn nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used.\nIt\u00a0involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This helps maximise the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue.\nStereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned.\nExternal radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to seven weeks. You won't need to stay in hospital overnight between\u00a0these appointments.\nIn some cases, internal radiotherapy may be required\u00a0where nasopharyngeal cancer has returned after initial treatment. A radioactive source is placed into or near the cancerous area and left in place for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.\nDepending on the type of treatment you have, you may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time.\nRadiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as:\n\nred and sore\u00a0skin in the treatment area\nfeeling sick\nchanges to your sense of taste\ndry mouth\u00a0\nhair loss\n\nThese side effects are usually temporary, but some can be permanent. Let your care team know if you experience these problems as treatment is often available to help.\nRead more about how radiotherapy is performed and the side effects of radiotherapy\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers.\nIt's usually given through a drip into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), with sessions every three to four weeks spread over several months. You won't usually need to stay in hospital\u00a0overnight\u00a0during treatment.\nLike radiotherapy, chemotherapy can cause a number of significant side effects, such as:\n\nfeeling sick\ndiarrhoea\nsore mouth\ntiredness\n\nThese side effects are usually temporary, but there's also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility.\u00a0You should discuss any concerns you have about the potential side effects of treatment with your care team before treatment begins.\nRead more about how chemotherapy is performed and the side effects of chemotherapy\nFollow-up\nAfter your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have regular follow-up appointments and scans to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.\nTo start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they'll become gradually less frequent over time.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for nasopharyngeal cancer depends on your age, general health and\u00a0how advanced the condition is when you're diagnosed.\nRadiotherapy alone can cure many very early-stage nasopharyngeal cancers, but many cases are diagnosed at a more advanced stage as the condition\u00a0doesn't always cause obvious symptoms until later on.\nMore advanced cancers are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. They're often curable if the cancer hasn't spread beyond the head and neck region.\nOverall, about 50 out of every 100 people (50%) diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer will live for five years or more after diagnosis.\nSurvival rates are better for younger people, but worse for older people. Around 70 out of 100 (70%) people under 45 years of age, and 35 out of 100 (35%) people aged 65 to 74, will live for five years or more after being diagnosed with\u00a0nasopharyngeal cancer.\nYou can read more about the\u00a0statistics and outlook for nasopharyngeal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.\n"}, {"Name": "Neuroblastoma", "Information": "\nNeuroblastoma is a rare cancer that mostly affects young children. It develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts.\nThese cells are found in a chain running down the back of the chest and stomach (abdomen).\nIn many cases, neuroblastoma first develops in the adrenal glands (the two small glands above the kidneys) and can spread to other areas such as the bones, liver and skin.\nNeuroblastoma affects around 100 children each year in the UK. It usually affects children under the age of five, and can even occur before a child is born.\nThe cause is unknown. There are very rare cases where children in the same family are affected, but it does not generally run in families.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread.\nIt's often hard to diagnose neuroblastoma in the early stages, as initial symptoms are common ones \u2013 for example, aches and pains, loss of energy and loss of appetite.\nA relatively late sign is a lump or swelling in the abdomen, as this is where the cancer commonly starts. This is easy to miss in a young child. This lump can cause\u00a0constipation and difficulty passing urine, as well as general pain and discomfort.\nOther signs can include:\n\na lump in the neck\nbone pain and difficulty walking, if the bones are affected\nnumbness, weakness or loss of movement in the child\u2019s lower body, if the cancer has affected the spinal cord\npale skin, bruising, bleeding and frequent infections, if the cancer has affected the bone marrow\nbluish lumps in the skin and the appearance of \"black eyes\"\n\nDiagnosing neuroblastoma\nA number of tests may be carried out if it's thought your child may have neuroblastoma.\nThese tests may include:\n\nurine analysis tests to check for certain chemicals\u00a0found in the urine that are produced by neuroblastoma cells\nscans of various parts of the body to look for areas affected by the cancer \u2013 such as ultrasound scans, computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\na special type of scan involving an injection of a substance that is taken up by neuroblastoma cells anywhere in the body,\u00a0called an mIBG scan\na\u00a0biopsy (removal of a tissue sample for microscopic examination) will allow the cancer to be identified \u2013 the sample is typically removed under\u00a0general anaesthesic using a special needle\n\nIf the lump is in one place and safe to remove with surgery, however,\u00a0then a preliminary biopsy is not necessary.\nOnce these tests have been completed, it will usually be possible to confirm a diagnosis of neuroblastoma and what \"stage\" it is at (see below).\nStages of neuroblastoma\nAs with most cancers, neuroblastoma is defined by stages that reflect the condition's spread. There are many staging systems, but the most widely used until recently is shown first, with the more recently agreed stages in brackets:\n\nStages 1 and 2 (L1) \u2013 the cancer is in one site and has not spread\nStage 3 (L2) \u2013 the cancer has spread to local structures, but not to distant parts of the body\nStage 4 (M) \u2013 the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body\nStage 4s (Ms) \u2013 this special stage is for tumours diagnosed in babies under the age of 12 months; although it may have spread to other parts of the body, the outlook is fairly good, because it can get better on its own\n\nTreatment and outlook\nThe outlook for neuroblastoma is generally better if the child is younger and the\u00a0cancer is confined to one site.\nBabies with Stage 4s neuroblastoma who have no symptoms may not need treatment, as the cancer may go away on its own.\nDepending on the stage,\u00a0chemotherapy is usually given to shrink the tumour before it is surgically removed, followed\u00a0in some cases by\u00a0radiotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.\nAlmost half of neuroblastoma cases are an aggressive form and, despite very intensive treatment, the cancer may return. In these cases, further treatment will often be necessary.\n"}, {"Name": "Neuroblastoma Children", "Information": "\nFewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with neuroblastoma. Most children who have this cancer are younger than five years old. Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumour in children that occurs outside of the brain and makes up 8% of the total number of children\u2019s cancers.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nNeuroblastoma\nNeuroblastoma develops from the cells left behind from a baby\u2019s development in the womb. The cells that it develops from are called neuroblasts.\n\n\u2018Neuro\u2019 means nerve\n\u2018Blast\u2019 means cells in early development\n\u2018Oma\u2019 means a group of cells, or a tumour\n\nNeuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body. The site of origin is either in one of the two adrenal glands situated in the abdomen (tummy) or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The adrenal glands are specialised glands that are found above the right and left kidney. The adrenal glands normally release hormones to maintain blood pressure, and enable us to respond to stress. In some cases, neuroblastoma can spread to tissues beyond the original site such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver, and skin.\nCauses\nAs with most cancers, the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. It is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe symptoms vary, depending on where your child\u2019s neuroblastoma tumour is.\n\nIf the tumour is in the abdomen, your child\u2019s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine\nIf the tumour affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing\nIf the tumour occurs in the neck, it\u2019s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing\nOccasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-coloured lumps\nIf the tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily. If your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements. They may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine.\nYour child may be found to have high blood pressure\nVery rarely, children may have jerky eye and muscle movements, and general unsteadiness associated with the neuroblastoma\n\nThere are often vague and non-specific associated symptoms of tiredness, pallor, loss of appetite, weight loss, bone pain and generalised discomfort.\nHow is neuroblastoma diagnosed?\nA variety of tests and investigations will be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. These include a biopsy of the tumour, blood and bone marrow tests, X-rays, CT or MRI scans, and a special nuclear medicine scan called an MIBG scan (see below). These tests are carried out to confirm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, and to find the exact position of the original site of neuroblastoma within the body and to see whether it has spread. This process is known as staging.\nA specific type of urine test will also be done. Nearly all children with neuroblastoma (9 out of 10) will have substances called vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), or homovanillic acid (HVA), in their urine. Measuring the VMA and HVA in the urine can help to confirm the diagnosis. Your child will also have their VMA and HVA levels checked during and after treatment. The levels of these substances will fall if the treatment is working. As these chemicals are produced by the tumour cells, and can be used to measure tumour activity, they are sometimes known as tumour markers.\nMost children will have an MIBG (meta-iodo-benzyl guanidine) scan. MIBG is a substance that\u2019s taken up by neuroblastoma cells. It\u2019s given by injection into the blood stream. Attaching a small amount of radioactive iodine to the MIBG enables any neuroblastoma tissue to be seen by a radiation scanner. Sometimes MIBG can be used as a treatment.\nBiopsy\nA small sample of cells (a biopsy) is usually taken from the tumour during an operation under a general anaesthetic. These cells are then examined under a microscope. Other tests collectively referred to as tumour biology, look at the chromosomes and \u2018biological markers\u2019 in the tumour cells. One of these \u2018markers\u2019 is called MYCN. The presence of a certain amount of MYCN in the cells (known as MYCN amplification) can suggest that the neuroblastoma may be a more aggressive type. In this situation, the treatment needs to be more intensive.\nStaging\nThe \u2018stage\u2019 of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the best treatment for your child.\nA commonly used staging system for neuroblastoma is described below:\nStage 1\nThe cancer is contained within one area of the body (localised) and there\u2019s no evidence of it having spread. It can be completely removed by surgery, or there may be very small (microscopic) amounts of tumour left.\nStage 2A\nThe cancer is localised and has not begun to spread, but cannot be completely removed by surgery.\nStage 2B\nThe cancer is localised and has begun to spread into nearby lymph nodes.\nStage 3\nThe cancer has spread into surrounding organs and structures, but has not spread to distant areas of the body.\nStage 4\nThe cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin or other organs.\nStage 4S (also called special neuroblastoma)\nThis stage of neuroblastoma is found in children under one year old. The cancer is localised (as in stage 1, 2A or 2B) and has begun to spread to the liver, skin or bone marrow.\nA newer staging system has been developed by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG). This system (described below) is now widely used. It looks at whether or not certain \u2018image-defined risk factors\u2019 are present in a neuroblastoma tumour before treatment. These risk factors can be detected by scans and help doctors understand the extent of the disease. Your doctor can explain more about this.\nStage L1\nThe tumour is localised and has not spread into important areas (vital structures) nearby. It can be removed by surgery.\nStage L2\nThe tumour is localised but has \u2018image-defined risk factors\u2019 and can\u2019t be safely removed by surgery.\nStage M\nThe tumour has spread to other parts of the body.\nStage MS\nThe tumour has spread to the skin, liver and/or the bone marrow in children younger than 18 months old.\nIf the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, this is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. If the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of neuroblastoma depends on the age of the child, the size and position of the tumour, the tumour biology (including the MYCN status) and whether the neuroblastoma has spread.\nSurgery\nFor tumours that have not spread (localised tumours), the treatment is usually surgery. If the tumour is at an early stage and there is no evidence that it has spread to the lymph nodes or any other parts of the body, an operation to remove the tumour, or as much of it as possible, will be undertaken. If the tumour is, at first, too large or in too difficult a position to remove safely, chemotherapy will be given to shrink it before surgery. A cure is usually possible for children with localised tumours. However, if a localised tumour is classed as \u2018high-risk\u2019, due to the tumour biology results, additional treatment with chemotherapy and usually radiotherapy will be needed.\nChemotherapy\nIf the tumour has already spread by the time of diagnosis, or is indicated as being high-risk by the tumour biology result, intensive chemotherapy is needed. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is usually given as an infusion into a vein. Your child will have a semi-permanent cannula called a central venous line inserted under a general anaesthetic to minimise the distress caused by intravenous injections.\nYour child\u2019s specialist will discuss with you the type and amount of chemotherapy needed.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nIf the neuroblastoma has spread to several parts of the body, or is high-risk with MYCN amplification, high dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell rescue is used after the initial courses of chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy will wipe out any remaining neuroblastoma cells but will also wipe out the body\u2019s bone marrow, where blood cells are made. To prevent the problems this causes, stem cells (blood cells at their earliest stages of development) are collected from your child through a drip before the chemotherapy is given. These stem cells are then frozen and stored until required. After the high-dose chemotherapy, the stem cells are given back to your child through a drip. They make their way into the bone marrow, where they grow and develop into mature blood cells over a period of 14\u201321 days.\nMonoclonal antibody treatment\nMonoclonal antibodies can destroy some types of cancer cells while causing little harm to normal cells. In the UK, patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated in the (SIOPEN) European high-risk clinical trial receive immunotherapy with a monoclonal antibody called anti-GD2 after their high dose therapy. There is good evidence from a clinical trial (research study) carried out in America, which was first reported on in 2009, that this may be a promising therapy when given alongside standard treatment for neuroblastoma. The anti GD2 is either given on its own or with cytokines. It is not yet a standard treatment for patients with neuroblastoma as it has very unpleasant side effects, the benefits need to be fully proven and the best way to administer it needs to be established. It is therefore currently only available to patients in the UK who are being treated within a clinical trial. Your child\u2019s specialist will be able to tell you much more about this treatment.\nRadiotherapy\nExternal beam radiotherapy may be given if the neuroblastoma is high-risk, or has spread to several parts of the body. This uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. External beam radiotherapy is given from a machine outside the body. Internal radiotherapy may sometimes be given using radioactive MIBG. Radioactive MIBG is similar to the MIBG used in an investigation to diagnose neuroblastoma, but uses higher doses of radioactivity to kill the cancer cells.\nYounger children\nChildren under 18 months old with neuroblastoma often have \u2018low-risk\u2019 tumours, and as long as there is no MYCN amplification, their outlook is excellent. Most children in this age group are cured.\nChildren with Stage 4S disease almost always get better with very little treatment or none at all. These tumours either regress spontaneously or after chemotherapy, which is only given if there are symptoms from the tumour. They disappear completely or develop into a non-cancerous (benign) tumour, called a ganglioneuroma. Many of these children, after their initial diagnostic tests and staging investigations, will just need careful monitoring for some years. Ganglioneuromas are usually harmless and will not cause any problems and do not need any treatment.\nSide effects of chemotherapy treatment\nChemotherapy often causes side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. The side effects will depend upon the actual drugs being given. Immediate side effects can include:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\ndiarrhoea\nweight loss\nhair loss\nincreased risk of infection\nbruising and bleeding\ntiredness\n\nLate side effects\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years after treatment. These include a change in the way the heart and kidneys work, hearing problems, fertility problems, a possible reduction in bone growth if radiotherapy has been given, and a slightly increased risk of developing another cancer in later life. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors organise many trials for children\u2019s cancer. Children in the UK with neuroblastoma can take part in national and European studies. The European research group is called SIOPEN. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nFollow-up after treatment usually involves regular visits to the hospital outpatients department, with scans and urine tests as necessary. For children who have had chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, more specialised tests \u2013 for example, hearing tests, kidney and heart function tests, and checking hormone levels \u2013 may also be carried out. These will be repeated until your child is grown up. If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Neuroendocrine Tumours", "Information": "\nNeuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare tumours that can occur in the cells of the neuroendocrine system.\nThe neuroendocrine system consists of nerve and gland cells. It produces hormones and releases them into the bloodstream.\nNETs are tumours (abnormal growths) that develop in the cells of the neuroendocrine system.\nNETs can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) and often\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but not always\u00a0\u2013 grow slowly. There are a number of different types of NET, depending on the specific cells affected.\nTypes of neuroendocrine tumours\nGastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs) are tumours that develop in the gut or pancreas.\nGastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI NETs) develop in the digestive system, which includes the bowel, stomach or oesophagus. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) develop in the pancreas.\nPulmonary neuroendocrine tumours develop in the lungs. Rarely, NETs can also develop in other parts of the body, including in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, kidneys, ovaries, or testicles.\nSome NETs, known as functioning tumours, produce hormones that cause specific symptoms. Tumours that don't cause symptoms are known as non-functioning tumours.\nSymptoms of neuroendocrine tumours\nThe symptoms of\u00a0a\u00a0neuroendocrine tumour\u00a0can vary depending on where it is and what hormones it produces.\nFor example,\u00a0a\u00a0tumour in the digestive system may cause diarrhoea,\u00a0constipation\u00a0or tummy pains. A tumour in the lung may cause wheezing or a persistent cough.\nSome tumours (functioning tumours) may cause abnormally large amounts of hormones to be released into the bloodstream.\nThis can\u00a0cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, flushing, cramps, wheezing,\u00a0low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), changes in blood pressure and heart problems.\nWhat causes\u00a0neuroendocrine tumours?\nWhat causes neuroendocrine tumours isn't fully understood.

In small number of cases it\u00a0can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed.\nThe main stages of NAFLD are:\n\nsimple fatty liver (steatosis) \u2013 a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason\nnon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)\u2013 a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population\nfibrosis \u2013 where persistent inflammation\u00a0causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby\u00a0blood\u00a0vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally\ncirrhosis\u00a0\u2013 the most severe stage, occurring after\u00a0years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can\u00a0lead to\u00a0liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and\u00a0liver cancer\n\nIt can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis\u00a0to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to\u00a0prevent the disease from getting worse.\nAm I at risk of NAFLD?\nYou're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you:\n\nare\u00a0obese or overweight\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an \"apple-like\" body shape)\nhave\u00a0type 2 diabetes\nhave\u00a0high blood pressure\nhave\u00a0high cholesterol\nare over the age of 50\nsmoke\n\nHowever, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children.\nAlthough it's very similar to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), NAFLD isn't caused by drinking too much alcohol.\nSymptoms of\u00a0NAFLD\nThere aren't usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won't know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.\nOccasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience:\n\na dull or aching pain in the top right of the\u00a0tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs)\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nunexplained weight loss\nweakness\n\nIf cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet\u00a0or tummy.\nRead more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.\nHow NAFLD is diagnosed\nNAFLD is often diagnosed after\u00a0a blood test\u00a0called a\u00a0liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don't always pick up NAFLD.\nThe condition may also be spotted during an\u00a0ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body.\nIf you're diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue (biopsy) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory.\nTreatment for NAFLD\nMost people with NAFLD won't develop any serious problems, but if you're diagnosed with the condition it's a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse.\nThere's currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications.\nYou may be advised to have regular appointments with your\u00a0doctor to check your liver function and\u00a0look for signs of any new problems.\nHealthy diet and lifestyle\nAdopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD.\u00a0The following can all\u00a0help:\u00a0\n\nLose weight \u2013 you should aim for a\u00a0BMI of 18.5-24.9. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it.\nEat a healthy diet \u2013 try to have a\u00a0balanced diet\u00a0high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too.\nExercise\u00a0regularly \u2013 aim to do at least 150 minutes of\u00a0moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don't lose weight.\nStop smoking\u00a0\u2013 if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\nNAFLD isn't caused by alcohol, but\u00a0drinking may make the condition worse. It's therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol.\nMedication\nThere isn't currently any medication that can treat NAFLD, but\u00a0various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition.\nFor example, your doctor may recommend medication to treat high blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, treat type 2 diabetes\u00a0and/or treat obesity.\nLiver transplant\nIf you develop\u00a0severe cirrhosis and your\u00a0liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant.\nFor adults,\u00a0the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors.\nAlternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using\u00a0a section of liver\u00a0removed from a living donor. As\u00a0the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow to a normal size.\nRead more about\u00a0liver transplants.\u00a0\n"}, {"Name": "Non Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Information": "\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.\nThe lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.\nIn non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nRead more about the symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\u00a0\nWho's affected?\nIn the UK, more than 12,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with most cases diagnosed in people over 65. Slightly more men than women are affected.\nWhat causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma?\nThe exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if:\n\nyou have a medical condition that weakens your immune system\nyou take immunosuppressant medication\nyou've previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which causes glandular fever\n\nYou also have a slightly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had the condition.\nRead more about the causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHow non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed\nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy.\nThis is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.\nRead more about diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nTreatment and outlook\nThere are many subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they can generally be put into one of two broad categories:\n\nhigh-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2013 where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively\nlow-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2013 where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years\n\nThe outlook\u00a0for non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type,\u00a0grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person\u2019s age.\nLow-grade tumours don't necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.\u00a0\nThe main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are:\n\nchemotherapy\nradiotherapy\u00a0\na\u00a0type of targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy\n\nOverall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable.

About 80 children of all ages develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the UK each year. It is more common in boys than girls.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming and there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it\u2019s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)\nThe lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body\u2019s natural defence against infection and disease. This is a complex system made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes throughout the body. The lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels.\nLymph nodes are also known as lymph glands, and the ones that you\u2019re most likely to notice are those in the neck, armpit and groin.\nThe number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another; in some parts there are very few, whereas under your arm there may be 20-50 nodes.\nCancers that start in the lymphatic system are called lymphomas. There are two main types of lymphoma:\n\nHodgkin lymphoma\u00a0\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\n\nAlthough they\u2019re both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment.\nThere are two main types of NHL. B-cell NHL usually involves the lymph nodes in the abdomen and intestines, but may involve nodes in the head and neck. T-cell NHL usually affects lymph nodes in the chest.\nOccasionally, NHL can develop in unusual places outside the lymph nodes. This is called extranodal lymphoma.\nCauses of NHL\nWe don\u2019t know what causes NHL but there is research going on all the time to try to find out. It is important to remember that nothing you have done has caused the cancer.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe first sign of NHL is usually a lump somewhere in the body, which is caused by swollen lymph nodes. This can cause different symptoms, depending on where the swollen lymph nodes are. If glands in the abdomen are affected, this may cause a feeling of being full after meals and some stomach pain. Other symptoms of NHL include a high temperature (fever), tiredness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. In a few children, lymphoma cells may be found in the bone marrow or in the fluid around the spinal cord(cerebrospinal fluid).\nHow it is diagnosed\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose NHL. Part, or all, of a swollen lymph gland, may be removed so that the cells can be examined in the laboratory (biopsy). This involves a small operation that is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Tests such as X-rays, ultrasound scans, MRI scans, CT scans, blood tests and bone marrow samples may be carried out to find out the extent of the disease. This is known as staging.\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\u00a0The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve.\nStaging\nThe stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. The type of treatment your child receives depends on the stage of the disease. A simplified version of the stages of NHL is below:\nStage 1\nOne group of lymph nodes is affected, or there\u2019s a single extranodal tumour.\nStage 2\nTwo or more groups of nodes are affected, or there is a single extranodal tumour that has spread to nearby lymph nodes, or there are two single extranodal tumours, but only on one side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs, which plays a large part in our breathing).\nStage 3\nThere\u2019s lymphoma on both sides of the diaphragm (either in two or more groups of nodes) or there are two single extranodal tumours or the lymphoma is affecting the chest.\nStage 4\nThe lymphoma has spread beyond the lymph nodes to other organs of the body such as the bone marrow or nervous system.\nTreatment\nTreatment for NHL has a very good success rate and many people are cured. Chemotherapy is the most important treatment for children with NHL. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.\nIt is common for a combination of drugs to be used and treatment may last a number of months or years. The treatment will be planned according to your child\u2019s particular type of NHL and the stage of the disease. B-cell NHL is treated with 4\u20138 courses of intensive chemotherapy. T-cell NHL is treated for about two years. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you.\nNHL can sometimes affect the brain and spinal cord. To stop this, chemotherapy may be injected directly into the fluid around the spinal cord. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.\nVery rarely, radiotherapy is also necessary. Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with a bone marrow transplant is sometimes used (again very rarely) if the NHL comes back (recurs) after initial treatment.\nSide effects of treatment\nTreatment for NHL can cause different side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the part of the body that\u2019s being treated and what treatment is being used. Some children have just a few side effects, while others experience more.\nSide effects can include:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea) and vomiting\na sore mouth\ntemporary hair loss\na low blood count leading to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding (sometimes blood and/or platelet transfusions are needed)\ntiredness\ndiarrhoea\n\nLate side effects\nMonths or years later some children will develop late side effects from the treatment they have had. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart, lungs and kidneys work, and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.\nAfter treatment with chemotherapy, some children - particularly boys - may become infertile. Older boys, and their parents, should be aware of the option of sperm banking. In this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years.\nYour child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects and will keep a close eye on possible long-term side effects in follow-up clinics. We have more detailed information about these late side effects.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Cancer research trials are carried out\nto try to find new and better treatments for cancer. Clinical trials mean there are now better results for curing children\u2019s cancers compared with just a few years ago. Your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nOnce treatment has finished, the doctors will monitor your child closely with regular appointments in the hospital outpatient department.\nOver 80% of the children who get NHL recover completely. The chances of successful treatment depend on the specific type, stage and grade of lymphoma. Your child\u2019s doctor can discuss these details with you.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Nosebleed", "Information": "\nNosebleeds can be frightening, but they aren't usually a sign of anything serious and can often be treated at home.\nThe medical name for a nosebleed is epistaxis.\nDuring a nosebleed, blood flows from one or both nostrils. It can be heavy or light and last from a few seconds to 15 minutes or more.\nWhat to do\nTo stop a nosebleed:\n\nsit down and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for at least 10-15 minutes\nlean forward and breathe through your mouth \u2013 this will drain blood into your nose instead of down the back of your throat\nplace an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables covered by a towel on the bridge of your nose\nstay upright, rather than lying down, as this reduces the blood pressure in the blood vessels of your nose and will discourage further bleeding\n\nIf the bleeding eventually stops, you won't usually need to seek medical advice. However, in some cases you may need further treatment from your GP or in hospital (see below).\nRead more about treating nosebleeds\nWhen to seek medical advice\nContact your GP or call NHS 24's 111 service if:\n\nyou're taking a blood-thinning medicine (anticoagulant) such as warfarin or have a clotting disorder such as haemophilia and the bleeding doesn't stop\nyou have symptoms of anaemia such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath and a pale complexion\na child under two years of age has a nosebleed\nyou have nosebleeds that come and go regularly\n\nAsk someone to drive you to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 for an ambulance if:\n\nthe bleeding continues for longer than 20 minutes\nthe bleeding is heavy and you've lost a lot of blood\nyou're having difficulty breathing\nyou swallow a large amount of blood that makes you vomit\nthe nosebleed developed after a serious injury, such as a car crash\n\nWhat causes nosebleeds?\nThe inside of your nose is full of tiny, delicate blood vessels that can become damaged and bleed relatively easily.\nCommon causes of nosebleeds include:\n\npicking your nose\nblowing your nose very hard\na minor injury to your nose\nchanges in humidity or temperature causing the inside of the nose to become dry and cracked\n\nOccasionally, bleeding can come from the blood vessels deeper within the nose. This can be caused by a blow to the head, recent nasal surgery and hardened arteries (atherosclerosis).\nRead more about the causes of nosebleeds\nWho gets nosebleeds?\nNosebleeds are fairly common and most people will experience them every now and again. Anyone can get a nosebleed, but they most often affect:\n\nchildren between two and 10 years of age\nelderly people\npregnant women\npeople who take blood thinning medication such as aspirin or anticoagulants, such as warfarin\npeople with blood clotting disorders, such as haemophilia\n\nBleeding may also be heavier or last longer if you take anticoagulants, have a blood clotting disorder, or have high blood pressure (hypertension).\nAre nosebleeds serious?\nNosebleeds aren't usually serious. However, frequent or heavy nosebleeds may indicate more serious health problems, such as high blood pressure or a blood clotting disorder, and should be checked.\nExcessive bleeding over a prolonged period of time can also lead to further problems such as anaemia.\nIf your GP suspects a more serious problem is causing your nosebleeds, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further tests.\nPreventing nosebleeds\nThings you can do to prevent nosebleeds include:\n\navoid picking your nose and keep your fingernails short\nblow your nose as little as possible and only very gently\nkeep your home humidified\nwear a head guard during activities in which your nose or head could get injured\nalways follow the instructions that come with nasal decongestants \u2013 overusing these can cause nosebleeds\n\nTalk to your GP if you experience nosebleeds frequently and aren't able to prevent them. They may refer you to an ENT specialist for an assessment.\n"}, {"Name": "Obesity", "Information": "\nThe term 'obese' describes a person who's very overweight, with a lot of body fat.\nIt's a common problem in the UK that's estimated to affect\u00a0around one in every four adults and around one in every five children aged 10 to 11.\nDefining obesity\nThere are many ways in which a person's health in relation to their weight can be classified, but the most widely used method is body mass index (BMI).\nBMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. You can use the BMI healthy weight chart\u00a0to work out your\u00a0score.\nFor most adults, a BMI of:\n\n18.5 to 24.9 means you're a healthy weight\n25 to 29.9 means you're overweight\n30 to 39.9 means you're obese\n40 or above means you're severely obese\n\nBMI isn't used to definitively diagnose obesity, because people who are very muscular sometimes have a high BMI without excess fat.\u00a0But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they're a healthy weight, overweight or obese.\nA better measure of excess fat is waist circumference, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29.9) or moderately obese (with a BMI of 30 to 34.9).\nGenerally, men with a waist circumference of 94cm (37in) or more and women with a waist circumference of 80cm (about 31.5in) or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.\nRead more about diagnosing obesity\nRisks of obesity\nIt's very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing\u00a0obvious physical changes, it\u00a0can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:\n\ntype 2 diabetes\u00a0\ncoronary heart disease\u00a0\nsome types of cancer, such as\u00a0breast cancer and\u00a0bowel cancer\nstroke\n\nObesity can also affect your quality of life and lead to psychological problems, such as depression\u00a0and\u00a0low self-esteem (see below for more information about the health problems associated with obesity).\nCauses of obesity\nObesity is generally caused by consuming more calories \u2013 particularly those in fatty and sugary foods \u2013 than you burn off through physical activity.\u00a0The excess energy is stored by the body as fat.\nObesity is an increasingly common problem because for many people modern living involves eating excessive amounts of cheap, high-calorie food and spending a lot of time sitting down, at desks, on sofas or in cars.\nThere are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these type of conditions don\u2019t usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medication.\nRead more about the causes of obesity\nTreating obesity\nThe best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly. To do this you should:\n\neat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian)\njoin a local weight loss group\ntake up activities such as fast walking, jogging,\u00a0swimming or tennis for 150 to 300\u00a0minutes (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week\neat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeat\n\nYou may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating.\nIf lifestyle changes alone don't help you lose weight, a medication called orlistat may be recommended. If taken correctly, this medication works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.\nIn rare cases, weight loss surgery\u00a0may be recommended.\nRead more about\u00a0how obesity is treated\nOther obesity-related problems\nObesity can\u00a0cause a\u00a0number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions.\nDay-to-day problems related to obesity include:\n\nbreathlessness\nincreased sweating\nsnoring\ndifficulty\u00a0doing\u00a0physical activity\noften feeling very tired\njoint and\u00a0back pain\nlow confidence and self-esteem\nfeeling isolated\n\nThe psychological problems associated with being obese can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression.\nSerious health conditions\nBeing obese can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious\u00a0health conditions, including:\n\ntype 2 diabetes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high\nhigh blood pressure\nhigh cholesterol\u00a0and\u00a0atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and\u00a0stroke\nasthma\nmetabolic syndrome \u2013\u00a0a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity\nseveral types of cancer, including bowel cancer, breast cancer\u00a0and womb cancer\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the oesophagus (gullet)\ngallstones\u00a0\u2013\u00a0small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder\nreduced fertility\nosteoarthritis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints\nsleep apnoea\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease\nliver disease and kidney disease\npregnancy complications,\u00a0such as\u00a0gestational diabetes or\u00a0pre-eclampsia (when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy)\n\nObesity reduces life expectancy by an average of\u00a03 to\u00a010 years, depending on how severe it is. It's estimated that obesity and being overweight contribute to at least\u00a01 in every 13 deaths in Europe.\nOutlook\nThere's no \"quick fix\" for obesity. Weight loss programmes take time and commitment, and work best when fully completed. The healthcare professionals involved with your care should provide encouragement and advice about how to maintain the weight loss achieved.\nRegularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals and involving your friends and family with your attempts to lose weight\u00a0can also help.\nRemember that even losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.\n"}, {"Name": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Ocd", "Information": "\nObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive activity.\nAn obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters a person's mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease.\nA compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought.\nFor example, someone with a fear of their house being burgled may feel they need to check all the windows and doors are locked several times before they can leave the house.\nOCD symptoms can range from mild to severe.

The condition typically\u00a0first starts to significantly interfere with a person's life during early adulthood, although problems can develop at any age.\nGetting help\nPeople with OCD are often reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed\u00a0or embarrassed.\nHowever,\u00a0if you have OCD,\u00a0there is nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. It is a long-term health condition like\u00a0diabetes or asthma,\u00a0and it\u00a0is not your fault you have it.\nSeeking help is important because it is unlikely your symptoms will improve if left\u00a0untreated, and they may get worse.\nYou should visit\u00a0your GP if you think you may have OCD. Initially, they will probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect you.\nIf your GP suspects OCD, you may need to be\u00a0referred to a specialist for an assessment and appropriate treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing OCD.\nHow\u00a0OCD is treated\nWith treatment, the outlook for OCD is good. Many people will eventually be cured of their OCD, or their symptoms will at least be reduced enough\u00a0that they can enjoy a good quality of life.\nThe main treatments for OCD are:\n\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 involving a therapy known as graded exposure with response prevention (ERP), which encourages you to face your fear and let the obsessive thoughts occur without \"neutralising\" them with compulsions\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2013\u00a0this medication can help reduce your symptoms by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain\n\nIf these treatments aren't effective or your condition is particularly severe,\u00a0you may need to be referred to a specialist mental health service for treatment.\nRead more about treating OCD.\n"}, {"Name": "Obstructive Sleep Apnoea", "Information": "\nObstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing.\nThis\u00a0may lead to regularly\u00a0interrupted sleep, which can have a big impact on quality of life and increases the risk of developing certain conditions.\nApnoea and hypopnoea\nThere are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA:\n\napnoea \u2013 where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it's called an apnoea when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more\nhypopnoea \u2013\u00a0a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or more\n\nPeople with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night.\u00a0These events may occur around once every one or two\u00a0minutes in severe cases.\nAs\u00a0many people with OSA experience episodes of both apnoea and hypopnoea, doctors sometimes refer to the condition as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, or OSAHS.\nThe term \"obstructive\" distinguishes OSA from rarer forms of sleep apnoea, such as central sleep apnoea, which is caused by the brain not sending\u00a0signals to the breathing muscles during sleep.\nSymptoms of OSA\nThe symptoms of OSA are often first spotted by a partner, friend or family member who notices problems while you sleep.\nSigns of OSA in someone sleeping can include:\n\nloud\u00a0snoring\nnoisy and laboured breathing\nrepeated short periods\u00a0where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snorting\n\nSome people with OSA may also experience\u00a0night sweats and may wake up frequently during the night to urinate.\nDuring an episode, the lack of oxygen\u00a0triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep\u00a0\u2013 either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness\u00a0\u2013\u00a0so your airway reopens and you can breathe normally.\nThese repeated sleep interruptions can make you\u00a0feel very tired during the day. You'll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you\u00a0may be unaware you have a problem.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee your GP if you think you might have OSA.\nThey\u00a0can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and can arrange for an assessment of your sleep to be carried out through a local sleep centre.\nAs someone with OSA may not notice they have the condition, it often goes undiagnosed.\nRead more about diagnosing OSA.\nCauses of OSA\nIt's normal for the muscles and soft tissues in the throat to relax and collapse to some degree while sleeping.

If left untreated, the symptoms will often persist and your mouth will continue to feel uncomfortable.\nIn severe cases that are left untreated, there is also a risk of the infection spreading further into your body, which can be serious.\nYour GP will usually\u00a0be able to diagnose oral thrush simply by examining your mouth. Sometimes they may also recommend blood tests to look for certain conditions associated with oral thrush, such as\u00a0diabetes and nutritional deficiencies.\nWhat causes oral thrush?\nLow numbers of the fungus Candida are naturally found in the mouth and digestive system of most people.

This means it cannot be passed to others.\nTreating oral thrush\nOral thrush can usually be successfully treated with antifungal medicines. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth (topical medication), although tablets or capsules are sometimes used.\nTopical medication will usually need to be used several times a day for around\u00a07 to 14 days. Tablet or capsules are usually taken once daily.\nThese medications don't often\u00a0have side effects, although some can cause\u00a0nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, bloating, abdominal (tummy) pain and diarrhoea.\nIf antibiotics or corticosteroids are thought to be causing your oral thrush, the medicine\u00a0\u2013 or the way it is delivered\u00a0\u2013 may need to be changed or the dosage reduced.\nPreventing oral thrush\nThere are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of developing oral thrush, including:\n\nrinsing your mouth after meals\nbrushing your teeth twice a day with a toothpaste that contains fluoride and interdental cleaning (flossing) regularly\nvisiting your dentist regularly for check-ups, even if you\u00a0wear dentures or have no natural teeth\nremoving your dentures every night, cleaning them\u00a0with paste or soap and water before soaking them\u00a0in a solution of water and denture-cleaning tablets\nbrushing your gums, tongue\u00a0and inside your mouth with a soft brush\u00a0twice a\u00a0day if you wear dentures or have no or few natural teeth\nvisiting your dentist if your dentures\u00a0do not fit properly\nstopping smoking\u00a0if you smoke\nrinsing your mouth with water and spitting it out after using a corticosteroid inhaler, and\u00a0using a spacer (a plastic cylinder that attaches to\u00a0the inhaler) when you take your medicine\nensuring that any underlying condition you have, such as diabetes, is well controlled\n\nIf you have a condition or are receiving treatment that could put you at a high risk of developing oral thrush, your doctor\u00a0may recommend taking a course of antifungal medication to prevent this happening.\nRead more about\u00a0taking care of your oral health.\n"}, {"Name": "Osteoarthritis", "Information": "\nOsteoarthritis is a condition that causes the joints to become painful and stiff.

About 30 children in the UK develop osteosarcomas each year. These tumours occur more commonly in older children and teenagers and are very rarely seen in children under five.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments. But it remains devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it\u2019s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nOsteosarcoma\nOsteosarcoma often starts at the end of the long bones, where new bone tissue forms as a young person grows. Any bone in the body can be affected, but the most common sites are in the arms and legs, particularly around the knee and shoulder joints.\nThere are several different types of osteosarcoma. Most occur in the centre of the bone. There are also rare subtypes, such as parosteal, periosteal, telangiectatic, and small cell osteosarcoma.\nCauses\nThere has been a lot of research into the causes of osteosarcoma but, like most childhood cancers, a definite cause is unknown. There are a few risk factors that have been associated with osteosarcoma. Children who have hereditary retinoblastoma (a rare tumour of the eye) have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Children who have previously had radiotherapy and chemotherapy also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. It is not caused by injuries or damage to the bone, although an injury may draw attention to a bone tumour.\nSigns and symptoms\nPain in the affected bone is the most common symptom. This pain may initially come and go, and then gradually become more severe and constant especially at night. There may also be swelling around the affected bone. Osteosarcoma is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the person has had a minor fall or accident. Some patients may develop a limp if the tumour is in the leg or pelvis.\nThese symptoms can be caused by many things other than cancer. However, any persistent bone pain should be checked by your child\u2019s doctor. Symptoms are often attributed to a sporting injury.\nHow osteosarcoma is diagnosed\nUsually you begin by seeing your family doctor (GP), who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. Many of the specific tests for diagnosing bone tumours require experience and specialist techniques so if a bone tumour is suspected, the doctor will refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre for further tests.\nThe doctor at the hospital will take your child\u2019s full medical history. They will then do a physical examination. This will include an examination of the painful bone to check for any swelling or tenderness. Your child will probably have a blood test to check their general health.\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose osteosarcoma. An X-ray of the painful part of the bone will usually identify a tumour, although sometimes they can be difficult to see.\nA small piece of the tumour will be removed and looked at under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. It\u2019s a small operation, performed under a general anaesthetic.\nOther tests are done to check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. These include a chest X-ray, blood tests, a bone scan and an MRI or CT scan.\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nGrading\nGrading refers to the appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope, and gives an idea of how quickly the cancer may develop. Low-grade cancer cells are usually slow-growing and less likely to spread.\nIn high-grade tumours the cells are likely to grow quickly and are more likely to spread.\nMost osteosarcomas are high-grade, but a type known as parosteal osteosarcoma is usually low-grade.\nStaging\nThe \u2018stage\u2019 of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nMost patients are grouped depending on whether cancer is found in only one part of the body (localised disease), or whether the cancer has spread from one part of the body to another (metastatic disease).\nA staging system commonly used for osteosarcomas is described below:\nStage 1A\nThe cancer is low-grade and is only found within the hard coating of the bone.\nStage 1B\nThe cancer is low-grade, extending outside the bone and into the soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels.\nStage 2A\nThe cancer is high-grade and is completely contained within the hard coating of the bone.\nStage 2B\nThe cancer is high-grade and has spread outside the bone and into surrounding soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels. Most osteosarcomas are stage 2B.\nStage 3\nThe cancer can be low or high-grade and is either found within the bone or extends outside the bone. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or to other bones not directly connected to the bone where the tumour started.\nIf the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer.\nTreatment\nTreatment will depend on a number of factors including the size, position, and stage of the tumour.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a very important part of treatment for osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells, and is usually given to shrink the main tumour before surgery. It\u2019s also given after the tumour has been removed by surgery, to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). It\u2019s common for a combination of drugs to be used.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy may occasionally be given. This treats cancer by using high energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.\nSurgery\nThe type and extent of surgery depends on the position and size of the tumour in the body. This surgery will need to be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic centre, and your child should be referred to one.\nSurgery may include removing the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone, which is then replaced by some form of false limb (prosthesis). If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery. Most children will be considered for limb-sparing surgery.\nAmputation\nSometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer is affecting the surrounding blood vessels and nerves.\nAfter amputation, a false limb will be fitted and will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs can work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sports.\nLimb-sparing surgery\nThere are two ways that limb-sparing surgery may be done:\n\nreplacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part)\nreplacing the affected bone with bone taken from another part of the body (bone graft)\n\nAfter this type of surgery, children will usually be able to use their limbs almost normally. However, they are advised not to participate in any contact sports. This is because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it.\nIf your child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened as the bone grows. This may mean there are extra short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened as an outpatient procedure.\nNew treatments for osteosarcoma\nMifamurtide, also called Mepact\u00ae, is a new type of biological therapy treatment. It may be offered to your child if they have had a surgical resection to remove the osteosarcoma and the tumour has not spread. It will be given along with chemotherapy after surgery to try and stop the osteosarcoma coming back. Mifamurtide is a relatively new drug and so more research needs to be done to fully understand its side effects and how to use it best.\nSide effects of treatment\nTreatment often causes side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend upon the treatment being given and the part of the body that\u2019s being treated.\nChemotherapy side effects\nSome general side effects of chemotherapy can include:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\nhair loss\nincreased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness\ndiarrhoea\n\nRadiotherapy side effects\nRadiotherapy can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness.\nSurgery side effects\nIf your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having.\nLate side effects\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.\nYour child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you and monitor your child for any potential late effects.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial, if there is a suitable one open. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancer. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. Your child\u2019s doctor can tell you if there are any trials available that might be suitable for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nMany children with osteosarcoma are cured. However, your child may need to have surgery to lengthen the affected limb as they grow. Your child will have regular check-ups and X-rays in the paediatric or adolescent oncology clinic, and at the orthopaedic centre.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it is best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\n"}, {"Name": "Otitis Externa", "Information": "\nOtitis externa is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the external ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and eardrum.\nOtitis externa is often referred to as \"swimmer's ear\" because\u00a0repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation.\nSymptoms of otitis externa include:\n\near pain, which can be severe\nitchiness in the ear canal\na discharge of liquid or pus from the ear\nsome degree of temporary hearing loss\n\nUsually only one ear is affected.\nWith treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. However, some cases can persist for several months or longer.\nRead more about the symptoms of otitis externa\nWhen to see your GP\nYou should see your GP if you may have otitis externa.\nYour GP\u00a0will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly use any items that are inserted into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They\u00a0may also examine inside\u00a0your ear using an instrument called an otoscope.\nIf you have recurring episodes of otitis externa that haven't responded to treatment, your GP may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help determine what type of infection you have, if any,\u00a0so appropriate medication can be prescribed.\nWhat causes otitis externa?\nMost cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection, although\u00a0the condition\u00a0can also be caused by:\n\nirritation\nfungal infections\nallergies\n\nThere are a number of things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including:\n\ndamaging the skin inside your ear\nregularly getting water in your ear\n\nGetting water in your ear is particularly significant, because this can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also\u00a0provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.\nRead more about the causes of otitis externa.\nWho is affected?\nOtitis externa is relatively common. It's estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives.\nThe condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults 45 to 75 years of age.\nPeople with certain long-term (chronic) conditions are at greater risk of developing the condition.\u00a0These include:\n\neczema\nasthma\nallergic rhinitis\n\nHow otitis externa is treated\nOtitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks. Your GP can prescribe ear drop medication that usually improves the symptoms within a few days.\nThere are a number of\u00a0different types of ear drops that may be used to treat otitis externa, but they all tend to be used several times a day for about a week.\u00a0\nYour GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice\u00a0if symptoms are severe or they fail to respond to treatment.\nRead more about treating otitis externa\nPreventing otitis externa\nTo help reduce your chances of developing otitis externa, you should avoid inserting\u00a0cotton wool buds and other things into your ears (including your fingers), as this can damage the sensitive skin in your ear canal.\nIf you're a regular swimmer, consider using ear plugs when swimming or wearing a swimming cap\u00a0to cover your ears and protect them from water.\nYou should also try to avoid getting water, soap or shampoo into your ears when you have a shower or bath.\nRead more about preventing otitis externa\nComplications\nComplications of otitis externa are uncommon, but some can be very serious.\nOne rare complication of otitis externa is necrotising otitis externa, which is where an infection spreads from the ear canal into the surrounding bone.\nThis\u00a0requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and sometimes surgery, as it can\u00a0be fatal if left untreated.\nRead more about the complications of otitis externa\n"}, {"Name": "Ovarian Cancer", "Information": "\nIn the UK, around 7,100 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year.\nIt's the fifth most common cancer among women after breast cancer, bowel cancer,\u00a0lung cancer and cancer of the uterus (womb).\nOvarian cancer is most common in women who have\u00a0been through\u00a0the\u00a0menopause\u00a0(usually over the age of 50), although it can affect women of any age.\nAs the\u00a0symptoms of ovarian cancer can be similar to those of other conditions, it can be difficult to recognise. However, there are early symptoms to look out for, such as\u00a0persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, and difficulty eating.\nIt's important to see your GP if you experience these symptoms, particularly over a\u00a0long period of time. Read more about how ovarian cancer is diagnosed.\nThe ovaries are a pair of small organs in the female reproductive system that contain and release an egg once a month. This is known as ovulation.\nDifferent types of ovarian cancer affect different parts of the ovaries. Epithelial ovarian cancer, which affects the surface layers of the ovary, is the most common type. This topic focuses\u00a0on epithelial ovarian cancer.\nWhat causes ovarian cancer?\nThe exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain things are thought to increase a woman's risk of developing the condition, such as age, the number of eggs the ovaries release and whether someone in your family has had ovarian or breast cancer in the past.\u00a0However, only 1 in 10 cases of ovarian cancer has a genetic link.\nRead more about the causes of ovarian cancer\nTreating ovarian cancer\u00a0\nThe treatment you receive for ovarian cancer will depend on several things, including the stage of your\u00a0cancer and your general health. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ovarian cancer, but your treatment will usually involve a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.\nRead more about how ovarian cancer is treated\nOverall, 72 out of every 100 women (72%) will live for at least one year after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Around 46 out of 100 (46%) women will live for at least five years, and about 35 out of 100 (35%) will live for at least 10 years. However, women with advanced ovarian cancer have a poorer survival rate.\nAs with most types of cancer, the outlook for ovarian cancer will depend on the stage it's at when diagnosed \u2013 that is, how far the cancer has advanced. The Cancer\u00a0Research UK website has more information\u00a0about the outlook for ovarian cancer.\nBeing diagnosed with\u00a0ovarian cancer can affect daily life in many ways. However, support is available for many aspects of\u00a0living with\u00a0ovarian cancer, including emotional, financial and long-term health issues.\nOvarian cancer screening\nThere are methods of screening for ovarian cancer but, currently, they haven't been fully tested. Screening\u00a0is only available for women who are at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene.\u00a0Clinical trials in the UK are currently being carried out to assess the effectiveness of screening in high-risk women and in the general population.

This is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). Your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby.\nYour reproductive system\nYour reproductive system is made up of:\n\n\nthe vagina - the passage from the cervix to outside your body\n\n\nthe cervix - the opening from the womb to the vagina\n\n\nthe womb (also called uterus) - where a baby grows during pregnancy\n\n\nthe fallopian tubes - which connect your ovaries to the womb\n\n\nthe ovaries - which store all your eggs and release one every month after puberty.\n\n\nFacts about ovaries\nYou have two ovaries - one on each side of your womb. They\u2019re about 4cm long.\nAt puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. These cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start.\nEvery month after puberty, your ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes to the womb. The womb\u2019s lining gets thicker, ready for an egg to be fertilised by a man\u2019s sperm. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the womb\u2019s lining comes out of your vagina as blood - this is a period.\nWhen a woman is about 50 her periods stop, because her ovaries have run out of eggs so they stop making hormones. This is called the menopause.\nTypes of ovarian cancer\u00a0\nThere are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours.\nTeenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. You may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called:\n\n\ndysgerminoma\n\n\nteratoma\n\n\nyolk sac tumour\n\n\nGerm cell tumours of the ovary are rare. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary. Treatment will usually cure germ cell tumours.\nYour specialist will explain more about the type of germ cell tumour that you have.

They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms.\nMost ovarian cysts occur as part of the normal workings of the ovaries. These cysts are generally harmless and disappear without treatment in a few months.\nSigns and symptoms\nAn ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries. In these cases, you may have:\n\npelvic pain \u2013 this can range from a dull, heavy sensation to a sudden, severe and sharp pain\npain during sex\ndifficulty emptying your bowels\na frequent need to urinate\nheavy periods, irregular periods or lighter periods than normal\nbloating and a swollen tummy\nfeeling very full after only eating a little\ndifficulty getting pregnant (although fertility is unaffected in most women with ovarian cysts\u00a0\u2013 see below)\n\nVisit your GP if you have persistent symptoms of an ovarian cyst.\nImmediately contact your GP, local out-of-hours service or NHS 111 service \u2013 or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department \u2013 if you have sudden, severe pelvic pain.\nThe ovaries\nThe ovaries are two small, bean-shaped organs that are part of the female reproductive system. A woman has two ovaries\u00a0\u2013 one each side of the womb (uterus).\nThe ovaries have two main functions. They are:\n\nto release an egg approximately every 28 days as part of the menstrual cylce\nto release the female sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, which play an important role in female reproduction\n\nOvarian cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect one.\nTypes of ovarian cyst\nThe two main types of ovarian are:\n\nfunctional ovarian cysts \u2013 cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and short-lived; these are the most common type of ovarian cyst\npathological ovarian cysts \u2013 cysts that occur\u00a0due to\u00a0abnormal cell growth; these are much less common\n\nOvarian cysts can sometimes also be caused by an underlying condition, such as endometriosis.\nThe vast majority of ovarian cysts are non-cancerous (benign), although a small number are cancerous (malignant). Cancerous cysts are more common in women who have been through the menopause.\nRead more about the causes of ovarian cysts\nDiagnosing ovarian cysts\nIf your GP thinks you may have an ovarian cyst, you'll probably be referred for an\u00a0ultrasound scan, carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina.\nIf a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan, you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks, or your GP may refer you to a gynaecologist (a doctor who specialises in female reproductive health).\nIf there is any concern that\u00a0your cyst could be cancerous, your doctor will also arrange\u00a0blood tests to look for high levels of chemicals that can indicate ovarian cancer.\nHowever, having high levels of these chemicals doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer, as high levels can also be caused by non-cancerous conditions such as\u00a0endometriosis, a pelvic infection, fibroids or even being on your period.\nHow ovarian cysts are treated\nWhether an ovarian cyst needs to be treated will depend on:\n\nits size and appearance\nwhether you have any symptoms\nwhether you have\u00a0been through\u00a0the menopause\n\nIn most cases, the cyst often disappears after a few months. A follow-up ultrasound scan may be used to confirm this.\nDue to the slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer\u00a0in post-menopausal women, regular ultrasound scans and blood tests are usually recommended over the course of a year to monitor the cyst.\nLarge cysts, those causing symptoms, and those that could be cancerous, may need to be surgically removed.\nRead more about treating ovarian cysts\n"}, {"Name": "Overactive Thyroid", "Information": "\nOveractive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body.\nExcess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body\u2019s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as:\n\nnervousness and anxiety\nhyperactivity \u2013 where a person can\u2019t stay still and is full of nervous energy\nunexplained or unplanned weight loss\u00a0\nswelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goitre, to form in the throat\n\nThe severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person.\nRead more about the symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland\nWhat causes an overactive thyroid gland?\nThe thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine.\nThey affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going.\nIn hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body's metabolism.\nThere are several possible underlying causes, the most common being Graves' disease, in which the body's immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones.\nRead more about the causes of an overactive thyroid gland\nTreatment\nAn overactive thyroid\u00a0usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms.\nThe three most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are:\n\nthionamides \u2013 a group of medications, including\u00a0carbimazole and methimazole,\u00a0that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone\nradioiodine treatment \u2013\u00a0a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland, reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health)\nsurgery \u2013\u00a0in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the\u00a0thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitre\n\nBeta-blockers may also\u00a0sometimes be used\u00a0to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland, although it doesn't target the thyroid gland itself.\nIt's common for treatment to lead to the thyroid not producing enough hormones.

Certain genes also increase your chances of getting pancreatitis, which in turn increases your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.\nCancer Research UK\u00a0has more information on risk factors and causes on their website\nDiagnosing pancreatic cancer\nYour GP will first ask about your general health and carry out a physical examination. They\u00a0may examine your tummy (abdomen) for a lump and to see whether your liver is enlarged.\nThey'll also check your skin and eyes\u00a0for signs of\u00a0jaundice and\u00a0may request a urine sample and blood test.\nIf your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you'll usually be referred to a specialist at a hospital for further investigation. You may have either:\n\nan ultrasound scan\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\na\u00a0positron emission tomography (PET) scan\u00a0\u2013 where you're given an injection of a very small amount of radioactive medication, known as a tracer, which helps to show up cancers in an image\n\nDepending on the results of a scan, further tests may include:\n\nan\u00a0endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS)\u00a0endoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a type of endoscopy\u00a0which allows\u00a0close-up ultrasound pictures to be taken of your pancreas\u00a0\nan endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\u00a0\u2013 a type of endoscopy\u00a0which is used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts; the dye will show up on an\u00a0X-ray and highlight any tumours\na\u00a0laparoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to see inside your body using a laparoscopy\u00a0(a thin,\u00a0flexible microscope)\n\nA\u00a0biopsy, where a small sample is taken from a suspected tumour, may also be carried out during these procedures.\nNICE guidelines\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nTreating pancreatic cancer\nCancer of the pancreas is difficult to treat. It\u00a0rarely causes any symptoms in the early stages, so it's often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. If the tumour is\u00a0large, treating the cancer will be more difficult.\nIf you've been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your treatment\u00a0will depend on the type and location of your cancer, and how far it's advanced. Your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration.\nThe first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells. If this isn't possible, treatment will focus on preventing the\u00a0tumour growing and causing further harm to your body.\nThe three main treatments for pancreatic cancer are:\n\nsurgery\nchemotherapy\nradiotherapy\n\nSome types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require two types of treatment or a combination of all three.\nRead more about\u00a0treating pancreatic cancer.\nRecovering from surgery\nRecovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.\nYou'll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.\nAfter any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won't be able to eat or drink straight away.\nYou'll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may\u00a0be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.\nAfter the tumour has been removed, you'll probably have a six-month course of chemotherapy, which greatly increases your chance of being cured.\u00a0But because\u00a0cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don't recover\u00a0completely.\nTreatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth.\n"}, {"Name": "Panic Disorder", "Information": "\nPanic disorder is where you have recurring and regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason.\nEveryone experiences feelings of\u00a0anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. It's a natural response to stressful or\u00a0dangerous situations.\nHowever, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time.\nAnxiety\nAnxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including\n\nphobias\u00a0\u2013 an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal\ngeneralised anxiety disorder (GAD) \u2013 a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations\npost-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening events\n\nPanic attacks\nA panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms.\nYou may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. As well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as:\n\nnausea\nsweating\ntrembling\na sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)\n\nThe number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week.\nRead more about the symptoms of panic disorder.\nPanic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they're not dangerous. An attack won't cause you any physical harm, and it's unlikely that you'll be admitted to hospital if you've had a panic attack.\nWhat causes panic disorder?\nAs with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood.\nHowever, it's thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors.\nRead about the possible causes of panic disorder.\nIt\u2019s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety. For example:\n\nmitral valve prolapse\npostural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (POTS)\nanaemia\nparoxysmal atrial tachycardia \u2013 episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly\nthyrotoxicosis \u2013 where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat, sweating, tremor and anxiety\npoorly controlled diabetes\nadrenal tumours \u2013 growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys)\ncarcinoid syndrome \u2013 a set of symptoms caused by some carcinoid tumours that can develop in the cells of the endocrine system (glands that produce and secrete hormones)\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome \u2013 causes overproduction of insulin and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\n\nDiagnosing panic disorder\nSee your GP if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above).\nYou may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.\nRead more about how panic disorder is diagnosed.\nTreating panic disorder\nThe aim of treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease the severity of your symptoms.\nPsychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.\nRead more about treating panic disorder and things you can do to help yourself during a panic attack.\nHaving panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. It's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability.\nGOV.UK has further information and advice about driving with a disability or health condition.\nComplications of panic disorder\nPanic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it's important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. Treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it's given at an early stage.\nLeft untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other phobias.\nAgoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn't be available if things go wrong.\nRead more about the complications of panic disorder.\n"}, {"Name": "Parkinsons Disease", "Information": "\nParkinson's disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over\u00a0many years.\nThe three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are:\n\ninvoluntary shaking of particular parts of the body (tremor)\nslow movement\nstiff and inflexible muscles\n\nA person with Parkinson's disease can also experience a wide range of other physical and psychological symptoms, including:\n\ndepression\u00a0and anxiety\nbalance problems\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this\u00a0may increase the chance of a fall\nloss of sense of smell anosmis\nproblems sleeping (insomnia)\nmemory problems\n\nRead more about the symptoms of Parkinson's disease\nSeeking medical advice\nSee your GP if you're concerned that you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nYour GP will ask about the problems you're experiencing and may\u00a0refer you to a specialist for further tests.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing Parkinson's disease\nCauses of Parkinson's disease\nParkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This\u00a0leads to a reduction\u00a0in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.\nDopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nExactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible.\nRead more about the causes of Parkinson's disease\nWho's affected?\nIt's thought around 1 in 500 people are affected by Parkinson's disease, which means\u00a0there are an estimated 127,000 people in the UK with the condition.\nMost people with Parkinson's start to develop symptoms when they're over 50, although around 1 in 20 people with the condition first experience symptoms\u00a0when they're under 40.\nMen are slightly more likely to get Parkinson's disease than women.\nTreating\u00a0Parkinson's disease\nAlthough there's currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible.\nThese include:\n\nsupportive treatments\u00a0\u2013 such as physiotherapy\u00a0and occupational therapy\nmedication\nin some cases, brain\u00a0surgery\n\nYou may not need any treatment during the early stages of Parkinson's disease, as symptoms are usually mild.

They'll ask you to undress from the waist down and lie back on the examination bed, while they feel for any lumps in your pelvic area.\nSome women may put off going to their GP if they're embarrassed or worried about what the doctor may find. However, the examination is important, only takes a few minutes and is similar to having a smear test.\nFurther tests\nIf you have bladder symptoms, such as needing to rush to the toilet or leaking when you cough and sneeze, further tests may need to be carried out in hospital.\nFor example, a small tube (catheter) may be inserted into your bladder to examine your bladder function and identify any leakage problems. This test is known as urodynamics.\nYour doctor will decide if further tests are needed before treating the prolapse.\nTypes of prolapse\nIf pelvic organ prolapse is confirmed, it will usually be staged to indicate how severe it is. Most often, a number system is used, ranging from one to four, with four indicating a severe prolapse.\nPelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of the vagina. The main types of prolapse are:\n\nanterior prolapse (cystocele) \u2013 where the bladder bulges into the front wall of the vagina\nprolapse of the uterus and cervix or top of the vagina \u2013 which can be the result of previous treatment to remove the womb (hysterectomy)\nposterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele) \u2013 when the bowel bulges forward into the back wall of the vagina\n\nIt's possible to have more than one of these types of prolapse at the same time.\nWhy does prolapse happen?\nProlapse is caused by weakening of tissues that support the pelvic organs. Although there's rarely a single cause, the risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse can be increased by:\n\nyour age \u2013 prolapse is more common as you get older\nchildbirth, particularly if you had a long or difficult labour, or gave birth to multiple babies or a large baby \u2013 up to half of all women who have had children are affected by some degree of prolapse\nchanges caused by the menopause \u2013 such as weakening of tissue and low levels of the hormone oestrogen\nbeing overweight, obese or having large fibroids (non-cancerous tumours in or around the womb) or pelvic cysts \u2013 which creates extra pressure in the pelvic area\nprevious pelvic surgery \u2013 such as a hysterectomy or bladder repair\nrepeated heavy lifting and manual work\nlong-term coughing or sneezing \u2013 for example, if you smoke, have a lung condition or allergy\nexcessive straining when going to the toilet because of long-term constipation\n\nCertain conditions can also cause the tissues in your body to become weak, making a prolapse more likely, including:\n\njoint hypermobility syndrome \u2013 where your joints are very loose\nMarfan syndrome \u2013 an inherited condition that affects the blood vessels, eyes and skeleton\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome \u2013 a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body\n\nCan a prolapse be prevented?\nThere are several things you can do to reduce your risk of prolapse, including:\n\ndoing regular pelvic floor exercises\nmaintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you're overweight\neating a high-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain bread and cereal to avoid constipation and straining when going to the toilet\navoiding heavy lifting\n\nIf you smoke, stopping smoking may also help to reduce your risk of a prolapse.\nHow is prolapse treated?\nMany women with prolapse don't need treatment, as the problem doesn't seriously interfere with their normal activities.\nLifestyle changes such as weight loss and pelvic floor exercises are usually recommended in mild cases.\nIf the symptoms require treatment, a prolapse may be treated effectively using a device inserted into the vagina, called a vaginal pessary. This helps to hold the prolapsed organ in place.\nSurgery may also be an option for some women. This usually involves giving support to the prolapsed organ. In some cases, complete removal of the womb (hysterectomy) is required, especially if the womb has prolapsed out.\nMost women experience a better quality of life after surgery, but there's a risk of problems remaining or even getting worse.\n"}, {"Name": "Penile Cancer", "Information": "\nPenile cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs on the skin of the penis or within the penis.\nIn the UK, around 550 men are diagnosed with cancer of the penis each year. It most commonly affects men over 60 years of age.\nOver the last 30 years, the number of penile cancer cases has increased by more than 20%, possibly due to changes in sexual practices.\nHowever, improvements in diagnosis, staging and treatment have led to a similar reduction in the number of deaths resulting from the condition.\nSigns and symptoms\nYou\u00a0should be aware of any abnormalities or signs of penile cancer, including:\n\na growth or sore on the penis that doesn't heal within four weeks\u00a0\nbleeding from the penis or from under the foreskin\na foul-smelling discharge\nthickening of the skin of the penis or foreskin that makes it difficult to draw back the foreskin (phimosis)\na change in the colour of the skin of the penis or foreskin\na rash on the penis\n\nIf you experience these symptoms, it's important that they're checked by your GP as soon as possible. It's unlikely they'll be\u00a0caused by cancer of the penis, but they need to\u00a0be investigated.\nAny delay in diagnosing penile cancer could reduce the chances of successful treatment.\nTypes of penile cancer\nThe penis is made up of many different types of tissue. The type of\u00a0penile cancer you have will depend on the type\u00a0of cell the\u00a0cancer developed from.\nThe most common types of penile cancer include:\n\nsquamous cell penile cancer \u2013 which accounts for more than 90% of cases and starts in the cells that cover the surface of the penis\ncarcinoma in situ (CIS) \u2013 a particular type of squamous cell cancer where only the cells in the skin of the penis are affected and it hasn't spread any deeper\nadenocarcinoma \u2013 cancer that starts in the glandular cells of the penis that produce sweat\nmelanoma of the penis \u2013 where the cancer develops in the skin cells that give the skin its colour\n\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the different types of penile cancer.\nWhat causes penile cancer?\nThe cause of penile cancer isn't known, but certain risk factors can increase your chances of getting it.\nMen who carry the\u00a0human papilloma virus (HPV)\u00a0have an increased risk of developing penile cancer, which is the virus that causes genital warts.\nStudies have found\u00a0that almost 5 out of 10 men (47%) with penile cancer also have an HPV infection.\nAge is also a risk factor for cancer of the penis. The condition rarely affects men under 40 years of age, and most commonly occurs in men aged over 60.\nSmoking is the most\u00a0significant lifestyle factor associated with penile cancer. Chemicals found in cigarettes can damage cells in the penis, which increases your\u00a0risk of getting the condition.\nConditions that affect the penis, such as phimosis, which\u00a0makes the foreskin\u00a0difficult to retract, increase your chances of developing infections such as balanitis.\nRepeated infections are linked to a higher risk of developing some types of penile cancer, because they can weaken your immune system.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of penile cancer.\nDiagnosing penile cancer\nYour GP will ask you about any symptoms you have and when they occur. They'll also examine your penis for signs of penile cancer.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of penile cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected penile cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nIf your GP suspects penile cancer, they\u00a0may refer you to\u00a0a specialist \u2013 usually a urologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the urinary system and genitals).\nThe specialist will ask about your symptoms\u00a0and check your medical history. They may also check for any physical signs of penile cancer.\nA blood test may be carried out to check your general health and the number of blood cells.\nTo confirm a diagnosis of penile cancer, you may need to have a biopsy. A\u00a0small tissue sample will be removed so it can be examined under a microscope\u00a0for cancerous cells.\nTreating penile cancer\nTreatment for penile cancer will depend on the size of the affected area and the rate at which the cancer has\u00a0spread.\nFor example, in most cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS), where only the skin cells of the penis are affected, treatment will usually involve either using a\u00a0chemotherapy cream or having laser surgery to remove the affected area of skin. You will usually have\u00a0a\u00a0skin graft after surgery.\nThe main treatments for penile cancer that isn't at a very early stage are:\n\nsurgery\nradiotherapy\nchemotherapy\n\nSurgery will involve removing the cancerous cells and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.\nIn most cases, any physical changes to your penis after an operation can be corrected with reconstructive surgery. Skin and muscle can be taken from elsewhere in the body to recreate a functioning penis.\nHowever, with early diagnosis and modern surgical techniques, your surgeon will usually be able to preserve as much penile tissue as possible.\nAs part of most treatments for penile cancer, the lymph glands (small organs that are part of the immune system) in the groin will be assessed to determine if the cancer has spread.\nThe test that's used, known as a sentinel node biopsy, is widely available in the UK. In some cases, the lymph glands may need to be surgically removed.\nAs with most types of cancer, the outlook for individual cases depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced at the time of diagnosis.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about\u00a0staging penile cancer and the types of treatment for cancer of the penis.\nYou can also read about penile cancer\u00a0on the male cancer website\u00a0Orchid. They also have a helpline you can call \u2013 0203 465 5766 (Monday to Friday, 9am-5.30pm).\nPrevention\nIt isn't always possible to prevent penile cancer, but you can reduce your chances of getting it.\nOne\u00a0of the main\u00a0ways you can reduce\u00a0your chances of developing penile cancer is to\u00a0give up smoking (if you smoke).\nIt's also important to maintain\u00a0good penis hygiene to prevent the bacterial and viral infections that\u00a0can increase the risk of penile cancer.\nThis is easier if you were circumcised as a child, but there are steps you can take if you haven't been circumcised. Simple penis hygiene can include:\n\nusing\u00a0condoms to help reduce the possibility of catching HPV\nregularly\u00a0washing your penis with warm water, including under the foreskin\n\nThere's little evidence to suggest that being circumcised as an adult will reduce your chances of developing penile cancer. However, if you have sores that don't heal, or if it's becoming increasingly difficult to\u00a0clean under your foreskin, seek advice from your GP\u00a0about the possibility of circumcision.\n"}, {"Name": "Peripheral Neuropathy", "Information": "\nPeripheral neuropathy develops when nerves in the body's extremities \u2013 such as the hands, feet and arms \u2013 are damaged.

You may be referred to hospital to see a neurologist\u00a0(a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system).\nGenerally, the sooner peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed, the better the chance of limiting the damage and preventing further complications.\nRead more about diagnosing peripheral neuropathy\nCauses of peripheral neuropathy\nIn the UK,\u00a0diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy.\nOver time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves. This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy.\nPeripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes. For example, it can be caused by:\n\nphysical injury to the nerves\na\u00a0viral infection such as\u00a0shingles\na side effect of certain medications or\u00a0drinking too much\u00a0alcohol\n\nPeople who are known to be at an\u00a0increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of peripheral neuropathy\nTreating\u00a0peripheral neuropathy\nTreatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause.\nOnly some of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated. For example, if you have diabetes it may help to gain better control\u00a0of your\u00a0blood sugar level, stop smoking and cut down on alcohol.\nNerve pain may be treated with prescribed medications called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers are often ineffective.\nIf you have other symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy, these may need to be treated individually. For example, treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy\u00a0and the use of walking aids.\nRead more about treating peripheral neuropathy.\nComplications of peripheral neuropathy\nThe outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged.\nSome cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas\u00a0in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time.\nIf the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy isn't treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected. This can lead to gangrene (tissue death) if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the affected foot has to be amputated.\nPeripheral neuropathy may\u00a0affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy). You may need treatment to increase your blood pressure or,\u00a0in rare cases, a\u00a0pacemaker.\nRead more about complications of peripheral neuropathy\n"}, {"Name": "Personality Disorder", "Information": "\nPersonality disorders are conditions in which an individual differs significantly from an average person, in terms of how they think, perceive, feel or relate to others.\nChanges in\u00a0how a person feels and distorted beliefs about other people can lead to odd behaviour, which can be distressing and may upset others.\nCommon features include:\n\nbeing overwhelmed by negative feelings such as distress, anxiety, worthlessness or anger\navoiding other people\u00a0and feeling empty and emotionally disconnected\ndifficulty managing negative feelings without\u00a0self-harming (for example, abusing drugs and alcohol, or taking overdoses) or, in rare cases,\u00a0threatening other people\u00a0\nodd behaviour\ndifficulty maintaining stable and close relationships,\u00a0especially with partners, children and professional carers\u00a0\nsometimes, periods of losing contact with reality\n\nSymptoms typically get worse with stress.\nPeople with personality disorders often\u00a0experience other mental health problems, especially depression and substance misuse.\nWhen and why personality disorders occur\nPersonality disorders typically\u00a0emerge in adolescence and continue into adulthood.\nThey may be mild, moderate or severe, and people may have periods of \"remission\" where they function well.\nPersonality disorders\u00a0may be associated with\u00a0genetic\u00a0and family factors.

Others may describe them as living in\u00a0a fantasy world of their own.\nAn example is paranoid personality disorder, where the person is extremely distrustful and suspicious.\nCluster B personality disorders\nA person with a cluster B personality disorder struggles to regulate their feelings and often swings between positive and negative views of others. This can lead to patterns of behaviour others describe as dramatic, unpredictable and disturbing.\nAn example is borderline personality disorder, where the person is emotionally unstable, has impulses to self-harm, and has intense and unstable relationships with others.\nCluster C personality disorders\nA person with a cluster C personality disorder struggles with persistent and overwhelming feelings of fear and anxiety. They\u00a0may show patterns of behaviour most people would regard as antisocial and withdrawn.\nAn example is avoidant personality disorder, where the person appears painfully shy,\u00a0socially inhibited, feels inadequate and is extremely sensitive to rejection. The person may want to be close to others,\u00a0but lacks confidence to form a close relationship.\nHow many people are affected?\nPersonality disorders are common mental health problems.\nIn England, it is estimated that around 1 in 20 people has a personality disorder. However, many people have only mild conditions so only need help at times of stress (such as bereavement). Other people with more severe problems may need specialist help for longer periods.\nOutlook\nMany\u00a0people recover from personality disorders over time. Psychological or medical treatment is sometimes helpful; sometimes support is all that is needed. This depends on the severity of the disorder and whether there are ongoing problems.\nSome\u00a0mild to moderate personality disorders improve with psychotherapy.\nDifferent types of psychological therapies have been shown to help people with personality disorders. However, there is no single approach that suits everyone and treatment should be tailored to the individual.

Further tests may be needed in some cases.\nPneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many symptoms with other conditions, such as the common cold, bronchitis and asthma.\nTo help make a diagnosis, your GP may ask you:\n\nwhether\u00a0you feel breathless or you're breathing faster than usual\nhow long you've had your cough,\u00a0and whether you're coughing up mucus and what colour it is\nif the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or out\n\nYour GP may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds.\nThey may also listen to your chest by tapping it. Lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound\u00a0from normal healthy lungs.\nIf you have mild pneumonia, you probably won't\u00a0need to have a chest X-ray or any other tests.\nYou may need a chest\u00a0X-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test or blood tests,\u00a0if your symptoms haven't improved within 48 hours of starting treatment.\nTreating pneumonia\nMild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by:\n\ngetting plenty of rest\ntaking antibiotics\ndrinking plenty of fluids\n\nIf you don't have any other health problems, you should respond well to treatment and soon recover, although your cough may last for some time.\nAs pneumonia isn't usually passed from one person to another, it's safe to be around others, including family members.\nHowever, people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better.\nFor at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital.\nThis is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person's health and age.\nRead more about\u00a0treating pneumonia.\nComplications of pneumonia\nComplications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly\u00a0and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes.\nPossible complications of pneumonia include:\n\npleurisy\u00a0\u2013 where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failure\na lung abscess\u00a0\u2013 a rare complication that's mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe alcohol misuse\nblood poisoning (septicaemia)\u00a0\u2013 also a rare but serious complication\n\nYou'll be admitted to hospital for treatment if you develop one of these complications.\nPreventing pneumonia\nAlthough most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren't passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading.\nFor example, you should:\n\ncover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneeze\u00a0\nthrow away used tissues immediately \u2013\u00a0germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouth\nwash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objects\n\nA healthy\u00a0lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. For example, you should avoid smoking\u00a0as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection.\nFind out\u00a0how to stop smoking.\nExcessive and prolonged\u00a0alcohol misuse\u00a0also weakens your lungs' natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia.\nPeople at high risk of pneumonia\u00a0should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine\u00a0and flu vaccine.\n"}, {"Name": "Polymyalgia Rheumatica", "Information": "\nPolymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a condition that causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips.\nThe main symptom is muscle\u00a0stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes.

They are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure.\nThey are sometimes known as \"bedsores\" or \"pressure sores\".\nPressure ulcers can range in severity from patches of discoloured skin to open wounds that expose the underlying bone or muscle.\nRead more about the symptoms of pressure ulcers.\nHow pressure ulcers develop\nPressure\u00a0ulcers can\u00a0develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. They can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time.\nThe extra pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin. Without a blood supply, the affected skin becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming.\nPressure ulcers tend to affect people with health conditions that make it difficult to move, especially\u00a0those confined to lying in\u00a0a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time.\nConditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such as type 2 diabetes, can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers.\nLearn more\u00a0about the\u00a0causes of pressure ulcers.\nWho is affected?\nIt's estimated that just under half a million people in the UK will develop at least 1\u00a0pressure ulcer in any given year. This is usually people with an underlying health condition \u2013 for example, around\u00a01 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with a sudden illness will develop a pressure ulcer.\nPeople over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin.\nTreating and preventing pressure ulcers\nTreatment for pressure ulcers includes the use of dressings, creams and gels designed to speed up the healing process and relieve pressure. Surgery is sometimes recommended for the most serious cases.\nFor some people, pressure ulcers are an inconvenience that require minor nursing care.

It is more likely that they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement).\nRead more about the symptoms of\u00a0prostate cancer\nWhat is the prostate?\nThe prostate is a small gland in the pelvis found only in men. About the size of a satsuma, it's located between the penis and the bladder and\u00a0surrounds the urethra.\nThe main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. It produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen.\nWhy does prostate cancer happen?\nThe causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. However, certain things\u00a0can increase your risk of developing the condition.\nThe chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men aged 50 or older.\nFor reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in men of African-Caribbean or African descent, and less common in men of Asian descent.\nMen who have\u00a0first-degree\u00a0male relatives (such as a father or brother) affected by prostate cancer are also at a slightly increased risk.\nRead more about the causes of prostate cancer\nTests for prostate cancer\nThere is no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you.\nThe most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are blood tests, a physical examination of your prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE) and a biopsy.\nThe blood test, known as a\u00a0prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, measures the level of PSA and may help detect early prostate cancer. Men are not routinely offered PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable.\nThis is because the PSA blood test is not specific to prostate cancer. PSA can be raised due to a large non-cancerous growth of the prostate (BPH), a urinary tract infection or inflammation of the prostate, as well as prostate cancer. Raised PSA levels also cannot tell a doctor whether a man has life-threatening prostate cancer or not. This means a raised PSA can lead to unnecessary tests and treatment.\nHowever, you can ask to be tested for prostate cancer once the benefits and risks have been explained to you.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing prostate cancer and PSA screening for prostate cancer\nHow is prostate cancer treated?\nFor many\u00a0men with prostate cancer, treatment is not immediately necessary.\nIf the cancer is at an early stage and\u00a0not causing symptoms, a policy of \"watchful waiting\" or \"active surveillance\" may be adopted. This involves carefully monitoring your condition.\nSome cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages. Treatments include surgically removing the prostate, radiotherapy and hormone therapy.\nSome cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms.\nAll treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, including erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. For this reason, many men choose to delay treatment until there is a risk the cancer might spread.\nNewer treatments,\u00a0such as\u00a0high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)\u00a0or cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects.\u00a0Some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy.

For some people it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have\u00a0a major impact on their quality of life.\nPsoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or\u00a0mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe.\nRead more about the symptoms of psoriasis.\nWhy it happens\nPeople with psoriasis have an\u00a0increased production of skin cells.\nSkin cells are normally\u00a0made and replaced every 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3\u00a0to 7\u00a0days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis.\nAlthough the process isn't fully understood, it's thought\u00a0to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system\u00a0is your body's defence against disease and infection, but for people with psoriasis, it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake.\nPsoriasis can run in families,\u00a0although the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear.\nMany people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a \"trigger\". Possible triggers of psoriasis include\u00a0an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines.\nThe condition isn't contagious, so it can't be spread from person to person.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of psoriasis.\nHow psoriasis is diagnosed\nA GP can\u00a0often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin.\nIn rare cases, a small sample of skin, called a biopsy, will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. This determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen planus, lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea.\nYou may be referred to a dermatologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe.\nIf your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specialises in arthritis). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken.\nTreating psoriasis\nThere's no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches.\nIn most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or topical corticosteroids. Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin.\nIf these aren't effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light.\nIn severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body.\nRead more about treating psoriasis.\nLiving with psoriasis\nAlthough psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.\nFor example,\u00a0some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. It's also quite\u00a0common\u00a0to develop\u00a0tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. This is known as psoriatic arthritis.\nSpeak to your GP or healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you\u00a0have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. They\u00a0can offer advice and further treatment if necessary. There are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such as The Psoriasis Association, where you can speak to other people with the condition.\nRead more about living with psoriasis.\n"}, {"Name": "Psoriatic Arthritis", "Information": "\nPsoriatic arthritis is a type of\u00a0arthritis\u00a0that develops in some people with the skin condition\u00a0psoriasis.

Make sure you let your doctor know if you're experiencing any problems with your joints.\nDiagnosing psoriatic arthritis\nIf your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment.\nA rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, and other types of arthritis \u2013 such as\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0and\u00a0osteoarthritis\u00a0\u2013 have been ruled out.\nA number of tests may be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis, including\u00a0blood tests\u00a0to check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis, as well as\u00a0X-rays\u00a0or scans of your joints.\nTreating psoriatic arthritis\nThe main aims of treatment will be to relieve your symptoms, slow the progression of the condition and improve your quality of life.\u00a0\nFor most people, this will involve trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. Ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible.\nThe main medications used to treat psoriatic arthritis are summarised below.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nYour GP may first prescribe\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0to see if they help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.\nThere are two types of NSAIDs and they work in slightly different ways:\n\ntraditional NSAIDs, such as\u00a0ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac\nCOX-2 inhibitors (often called coxibs), such as celecoxib or etoricoxib\n\nLike all medications, NSAIDs can have side-effects, but your doctor will take precautions to reduce the risk of these, such as prescribing the lowest dose necessary to control your symptoms for the shortest time possible.\nIf side-effects do happen, they usually affect the stomach and intestines, and can include indigestion\u00a0and\u00a0stomach ulcers. A medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that helps protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces will therefore often be prescribed alongside NSAIDs.\nIf NSAIDs alone are not helpful, some of the medications below may be recommended.\nSteroid medication (corticosteroids)\nLike NSAIDs,\u00a0corticosteroids\u00a0can help reduce pain and swelling.\nIf you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, your doctor may inject the medication directly into the joint. This can offer rapid relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months.\nCorticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or as an injection into the muscle, to help when lots of joints are inflamed. However, doctors are generally cautious about this because the medication can cause significant side effects if used in the long term, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it.\nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are medications that work by tackling the underlying causes of the inflammation in your joints. They can help to ease your symptoms and slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. The earlier you start taking a DMARD, the more effective it will be.\u00a0\nPsoriatic arthritis can be treated with a variety of DMARDs including:\n\nMethotrexate\nSulphasalazine\nLeflunomide\nCyclosporin\nAntimalarials (such as hydroxychloroquine)\nAzathioprine\nApremilast\n\nYour rheumatologist will discuss the most appropriate choice of DMARD for you.\nIt can take several weeks or months to notice a DMARD working. Therefore, it's important to keep taking the medication, even if it doesn't seem to be working at first.\nDMARD therapy is monitored according to guidelines such as British Society for Rheumatology (BSR).\nBiological treatments\nBiological treatments are a newer form of treatment for psoriatic arthritis. You may be offered one of these treatments if:\n\nyour psoriatic arthritis has not responded to at least two different types of DMARD\nyou are not able to be treated with at least two different types of DMARD because of other problems e.g. other diseases.\n\nBiological drugs work by directly blocking the chemicals in the blood, skin and joints that switch the immune system on, leading it to attack the lining of your joints and your skin.\nSome of the biological medicines you may be offered are adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab injections. See our page on\u00a0treating psoriasis\u00a0for more information about these medications.\u00a0 Newer biological drugs include ustekinumab.\nThe most common side-effect of biological treatments is a reaction in the area of skin where the medication is injected, such as redness, swelling or pain, although these reactions aren\u2019t usually serious.\nHowever, biological treatments can sometimes cause other side-effects, including problems with your liver, kidneys or blood count, so you'll usually need to have regular blood or urine tests to check for these.\nBiological treatments can make you more likely to develop infections, so you should tell your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of an infection, such as a sore throat, a high temperature (fever), urinary problems or\u00a0diarrhoea.\nBiological treatments usually take between 2 and 6 months to take effect.\nIf it's effective, the medication can be continued. Otherwise, your doctor may suggest stopping the medication or swapping to an alternative biological treatment.\nComplementary therapies\nThere isn't enough scientific research evidence to say that complementary therapies, such as balneotherapy (bathing in water containing minerals), works in treating psoriatic arthritis.\nThere is also not enough evidence to support taking any kind of food supplement as treatment.\nComplementary therapies can sometimes react with other treatments, so you should talk to your GP, specialist or pharmacist if you're thinking of using any.\nManaging related conditions\nAs with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions \u2013 such as\u00a0cardiovascular disease (CVD)\u00a0\u2013 if you have psoriatic arthritis. CVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as\u00a0heart disease\u00a0and\u00a0stroke.\nYour doctor should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have CVD and offer additional treatment, if necessary.\nYou can also help yourself by:\n\nhaving a good balance between rest and regular physical activity\nlosing weight, if you're overweight\nnot smoking\nonly drinking moderate amounts of alcohol\n\nRead more about\u00a0living with psoriasis\u00a0and\u00a0preventing CVD.\nPsoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the eyes, such as Conjunctivitis and Iritis.\nIf psoriatic arthritis affects your skin and joints, you may notice changes in your nails such as:\n\ndents\npits\ndiscolouration\nloosening from the nail bed\n\nThis is less common if only your skin is affected.\nYour care team\nAs well as your GP and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by:\n\na specialist nurse\u00a0\u2013 who will often be your first point of contact with your specialist care team\na dermatologist (skin specialist)\u00a0\u2013 who will be responsible for treating your psoriasis symptoms\na physiotherapist\u00a0\u2013 who can devise an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile\nan occupational therapist\u00a0\u2013 who can identify any problems you have in everyday activities and find ways to overcome or manage these\na psychologist\u00a0\u2013 who can offer psychological support if you need it\na podiatrist who can offer assessment and advice on foot problems if affected during the course of PSA.\n\nOutlook\nLike psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse.\nIn severe cases, there is a risk of the joints becoming permanently damaged or deformed, which may require surgical treatment.\nHowever, with an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it's possible to slow down the progression of the condition and minimise or prevent permanent damage to the joints.\n"}, {"Name": "Psychosis", "Information": "\nPsychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. This might involve hallucinations or delusions.\nThe two main\u00a0symptoms of psychosis are:\n\nhallucinations\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren't there; a common hallucination is hearing voices\ndelusions \u2013\u00a0where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example,\u00a0thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you\n\nThe combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour.\nExperiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode.\nWhat causes psychosis?\nPsychosis isn't a condition in itself\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it's triggered by\u00a0other conditions.\nIt's\u00a0sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as:\n\nschizophrenia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions\nbipolar disorder\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a mental health condition that affects mood; a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes of\u00a0depression\u00a0(lows) and mania (highs)\nsevere depression \u2013\u00a0some people with depression also have symptoms of psychosis when they're very depressed\n\nPsychosis can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, or physical conditions, such as\u00a0Parkinson's disease, a brain tumour, or as\u00a0a result of\u00a0drug\u00a0misuse or alcohol misuse.\nHow often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause.\nFor example, schizophrenia can be long term, but most people can make a good recovery and about a quarter only have a single psychotic episode. Episodes related to bipolar disorder usually resolve, but may recur.\nRead more about the causes of psychosis.\nDiagnosing psychosis\nYou should see your GP immediately if you're experiencing psychotic episodes. It's important psychosis is treated as soon as possible as early treatment usually has better long-term outcomes.\nYour GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse. They may ask you some questions to help determine what's causing your psychosis. For example, they may ask you:\n\nwhether you're taking any medication\nwhether you've been taking illegal substances\nhow your mood has been\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you've been depressed\nhow you've been functioning day-to-day\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you're still working\nwhether you have a family history of mental health conditions\u00a0\u2013 such as schizophrenia\nabout your hallucinations\u00a0\u2013 such as whether you've heard voices\nabout your delusions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as whether you feel people are controlling you\nwhether you have any other symptoms\n\nYour GP should refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing psychosis.\nTreating psychosis\nTreatment for psychosis involves using a combination of:\n\nantipsychotic medication \u2013\u00a0which can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis\npsychological therapies \u2013\u00a0the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0has proved successful in helping people with schizophrenia;\u00a0in appropriate cases, family therapy has been shown to reduce the need for hospital treatment in people with psychosis\nsocial support \u2013\u00a0support with social needs, such as education, employment, or accommodation\n\nMost people with psychosis who get better with medication need to continue taking it for at least a year. Some people need to take medication long term to prevent symptoms recurring.\nIf a person's psychotic episodes are severe, they may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.\nRead more about the treatment of psychosis.\nGetting help for others\nPeople with psychosis often have a lack of insight. They're unaware that they're thinking and acting strangely.\nBecause of\u00a0their lack of insight,\u00a0it's often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them.\nIf you're concerned about someone you know and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they've previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. If you think the person's symptoms are placing them at possible risk of harm, you can:\n\ntake them to the nearest\u00a0accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree\ncall their GP or\u00a0local out-of-hours GP\ncall 999 and ask for an ambulance\n\nComplications\nPeople with a history of psychosis are much more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both.\nThis may be because these\u00a0substances can provide short-term symptom relief, although they usually make symptoms worse in the long term.\nPeople with psychosis also have a higher than average risk of\u00a0suicide. It's estimated\u00a01 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt to commit suicide at some point in their life, and\u00a01 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves.\nSide effects can also occur if someone is\u00a0taking antipsychotics on a long-term basis. Weight gain is a common side effect. In rare cases,\u00a0a person with psychosis may\u00a0also develop type 2 diabetes.\nRead more about the complications of psychosis.\n"}, {"Name": "Rare Tumours", "Information": "\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nTypes of rare cancers in children\nRare cancers in children make up fewer than 1 in 30 of all childhood cancers and can broadly be grouped as:\n\nrare cancers that only affect children, such as pancreatoblastoma, malignant rhabdoid tumours and melanotic neuroectodermal tumours of infancy\ncancers that usually only affect adults, such as cancers of the digestive system, the thyroid and the adrenal gland\nrare cancers in the head and neck area, such as nasopharyngeal cancer\nrare hormonal/endocrine cancers, such as phaeochromocytoma\nrare brain tumours, such as meningioma\nrare skin cancers, such as melanomas\n\nCauses\nThe causes of most rare childhood cancers are unknown. But if other family members have had particular types of cancer, this may sometimes suggest that there is an inherited faulty gene in the family. If this is a possibility, your child\u2019s specialist will talk to you about it.\nTreatment\nRare cancers are treated with the same treatments used for other childhood cancers. This includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Your child may need a combination of these treatments.\nSurgery\nUsually an operation is done to remove all or as much of the cancer as possible. Other treatments, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, may be given after or sometimes before surgery. They may also be used if an operation is not possible.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It can be used to treat any cancer cells that may be left behind after surgery, or to shrink a cancer.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein. Chemotherapy may be used to lower the risk of the cancer coming back or to treat cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.\nResearch\nClinical trials are usually not available as the number of children with rare cancers is so small. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) aims to improve the care and treatment of children with cancer and it develops guidelines on the best ways of treating and managing those with rare tumours. Doctors communicate with specialist colleagues in other countries to promote research in rare tumours and develop new forms of treatment.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Raynauds Phenomenon", "Information": "\nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body \u2013 usually the fingers and toes.\nIt's often referred to as Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, Raynaud\u2019s\u00a0disease or just Raynaud's.\nWhy does it happen?\nRaynaud\u2019s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood.\nThis causes the affected area to change colour to white, then blue and then red, as the bloodflow returns.\u00a0You may also experience numbness, pain, and pins and needles.\nSymptoms of Raynaud's can last\u00a0from a few minutes to several hours.\nIt's not\u00a0a serious threat to your health, but can be annoying to live with,\u00a0because it can be difficult to use your fingers.\u00a0People with Raynaud\u2019s often go for long periods without any symptoms, and sometimes the condition goes away altogether.\nOther parts of the body that can be affected by Raynaud\u2019s include the ears, nose, nipples and lips.\nTreating Raynaud's\nIn many cases, it may be possible to control the symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s yourself by avoiding the cold, wearing gloves and using relaxation techniques when feeling stressed.\nStopping smoking can also improve symptoms, as smoking can affect your circulation.\nIf you're unable to control your symptoms yourself, then a medication called nifedipine may be recommended.\nRead more about treating Raynaud\u2019s.\nTypes of Raynaud's\nThere are two types of Raynaud's:\n\nprimary \u2013 when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type)\nsecondary \u2013 when it's caused by\u00a0another health condition\n\nMost cases of secondary Raynaud\u2019s are associated with conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue (autoimmune conditions), such as rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0and lupus.\nThe causes of primary Raynaud\u2019s\u00a0are unclear. However\u00a01 in 10 people with primary Raynaud\u2019s goes on to develop a condition associated with secondary Raynaud\u2019s, such as lupus.\nYour GP can help to determine whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud's\u00a0by examining your symptoms and carrying out blood tests.\nRead more about what causes Raynaud\u2019s\u00a0and diagnosing Raynaud's.\nPossible complications\nSecondary Raynaud\u2019s can severely restrict the\u00a0blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even\u00a0tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. However, severe complications are rare.\nRead more about the complications of Raynaud\u2019s.\nWho gets Raynaud\u2019s?\nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon is a common condition. It affects up to 20% of the adult population worldwide. There may be as many as 10 million people with the condition in the UK.\nPrimary Raynaud\u2019s usually begins in your 20s or 30s. Secondary Raynaud\u2019s can develop at any age, depending on the cause.\nRaynaud's is slightly more common in women than men.\n"}, {"Name": "Reactive Arthritis", "Information": "\nReactive arthritis, formerly known as Reiter's syndrome, is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) in various places in the body.\nIt usually develops following an infection, and in most cases clears up in a few months without\u00a0causing long-term problems.\nThe three most common places\u00a0affected by reactive arthritis\u00a0are:\n\nthe joints (arthritis), which can cause\u00a0pain, stiffness and swelling\nthe eyes (conjunctivitis), which can cause\u00a0eye pain and redness\nthe urethra\u00a0(non-gonococcal urethritis), which can cause pain when urinating (the urethra\u00a0is the tube that carries urine out of the body)\u00a0\n\nHowever,\u00a0most people will not experience all of these problems.\u00a0\nRead more about the symptoms of reactive arthritis.\nWhat causes reactive arthritis?\nReactive arthritis usually develops within four weeks of an infection, typically after a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel.\nFor reasons that are still unclear, the immune system (the body's defence against infection) appears to malfunction in response to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed.\nRead more about the causes of reactive arthritis.\nSeeking medical advice\nSee\u00a0your GP if\u00a0you have\u00a0swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had\u00a0symptoms of an infection such as diarrhoea or pain when passing urine.\nThere is no single test for reactive arthritis, although blood and urine tests, genital swabs\u00a0and X-rays may be used to check for\u00a0infection and rule out other causes of your symptoms.\nYour GP will also want to know about your recent medical history,\u00a0such as whether you may have recently had a\u00a0bowel infection or an STI.\nHow reactive arthritis is treated\nThere is currently no cure for reactive arthritis, but most people get better in around six months. Meanwhile, treatment can help to relieve symptoms such as pain and stiffness.\nSymptoms can\u00a0often be controlled using\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and painkillers such as ibuprofen.\nSevere symptoms\u00a0may\u00a0require more powerful steroid medication (corticosteroids) or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\nRead more about treating reactive arthritis.\nWho is affected\nReactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young adults aged 20-40.\nMen are generally affected more than woman\u00a0\u2013 particularly in cases linked to STIs, which are estimated to be about 10 times more common in men.\nPeople who have a certain gene called HLA-B27, which is found in around one in every 10 people in the\u00a0UK,\u00a0are about thought to be around 50 times more likely to develop reactive arthritis than those who don't have this gene.\nPreventing reactive arthritis\nThe most effective way to reduce your risk of reactive arthritis is to avoid the STIs and\u00a0bowel infections that most commonly\u00a0cause the condition.\nThe most effective way of preventing STIs is to always use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, during sex with a new partner.\u00a0\nRead advice\u00a0on STIs, contraception and sexual health.\nEnsuring good standards of hygiene when preparing and storing food can help to prevent gastrointestinal infections.\u00a0Read about\u00a0preventing food poisoning.\n"}, {"Name": "Restless Legs Syndrome", "Information": "\nRestless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common condition of the nervous system that causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs.\nIt can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation\u00a0in the feet, calves and thighs. The sensation is often worse in the evening\u00a0or at night. Occasionally, the arms are affected too.\nRestless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).\nSome people have\u00a0the symptoms of restless legs syndrome occasionally, while others have them every day. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, restless legs syndrome can be very distressing and disrupt a person's daily activities.\nWhat causes restless legs syndrome?\nIn the majority of cases, there's no obvious cause of\u00a0restless legs syndrome. This known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families.\nSome neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles\u00a0a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and\u00a0may\u00a0be responsible for\u00a0the involuntary leg movements associated with\u00a0restless legs syndrome.\nIn some cases, restless legs syndrome is caused by an underlying health condition,\u00a0such as iron deficiency anaemia\u00a0or kidney failure. This is known as secondary\u00a0restless legs syndrome.\nThere's also a link between\u00a0restless legs syndrome and pregnancy. About 1 in\u00a05 pregnant women will experience symptoms in the last three months of their pregnancy, although it's not clear exactly why this is. In such cases,\u00a0restless legs syndrome usually disappears after the woman has given birth.\nRead more about the causes of restless legs syndrome\nTreating restless legs syndrome\nMild cases of\u00a0restless legs syndrome that aren't linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes, such as:\n\nadopting\u00a0good sleep habits\u00a0\u2013 for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night\nquitting smoking\u00a0if you\u00a0smoke\nexercising regularly\u00a0during the daytime\n\nIf your symptoms\u00a0are more severe, you may need medication to regulate the levels of dopamine and iron\u00a0in your body.\nIf\u00a0restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that's needed to treat the symptoms.\nRead more about treating restless legs syndrome\nWho's affected by restless legs syndrome?\nAs many as 1 in 10 people are affected by\u00a0restless legs syndrome at some point in their life.\nWomen are twice as likely to develop\u00a0restless legs syndrome than men.

However, you should get them checked by your GP as soon as possible.\nIt's unusual for retinoblastoma to progress unnoticed beyond the age of 5.\u00a0Signs in older children include\u00a0the eye appearing red, sore or swollen, and some\u00a0loss of vision in the affected eye.\nWhat causes retinoblastoma?\nRetinoblastoma is cancer of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye.\nDuring the early stages of a baby's development, retinal eye cells grow very quickly and then stop growing. However, in rare cases, one or more cells continue to grow and form a cancer called retinoblastoma.\nIn about 4 out of 10 (40%) of cases, retinoblastoma is caused by a faulty gene, which often affects both eyes (bilateral). The faulty gene\u00a0may be inherited from a parent, or a change to the gene (mutation) may occur at an early stage of the child's development in the womb.\nIt's not known what causes the remaining 60% of retinoblastoma cases. In these cases, there's no faulty gene and only 1 eye is affected (unilateral).\nAround 50 to 60 children are diagnosed with retinoblastoma in the UK each year.\nDiagnosing retinoblastoma\nYour GP will carry out a\u00a0'red reflex test' in a darkened room\u00a0using an ophthalmoscope (a magnifying\u00a0instrument with\u00a0a light at one end).\nWhen a light is shone into your child's eyes, your GP will see a red reflection\u00a0if the retina is normal. If the reflection is white,\u00a0it may be a sign of an eye condition such as cataracts, retinal detachment\u00a0or retinoblastoma. In this case, your child\u00a0will be urgently referred (within 2 weeks) to an eye specialist for further investigation.\nThe eye specialist (ophthalmologist)\u00a0will examine your child's eyes, and they may carry out another red reflex test. Eye drops will be used to increase the size of your child's pupils, allowing a clear view of the retina at the back of the eye.\nAn\u00a0ultrasound\u00a0scan is also sometimes used to help diagnose retinoblastoma. This is a painless procedure where gel is rubbed on the outside of the eyelid and a small\u00a0ultrasound probe is placed on the eyelid, which scans the eye.\nAfter these investigations,\u00a0if the eye specialist thinks your child has retinoblastoma they'll refer them\u00a0to one of two specialist\u00a0retinoblastoma treatment centres,\u00a0either at\u00a0The Royal London Hospital\u00a0(RLH)\u00a0or the Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH).\nYour child's appointment should be within a week of being seen at your local eye clinic. At the specialist centre, your child will need to have a\u00a0general anaesthetic so their eyes can be thoroughly examined and a diagnosis of retinoblastoma can be confirmed or ruled out.\nTreating retinoblastoma\nYour child will be treated by a specialist retinoblastoma team at either the Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital.\nHowever, if your child needs\u00a0chemotherapy, it will usually be carried out at a local children's cancer centre and overseen by the retinoblastoma team at 1 of the 2 specialist hospitals.\nThe recommended\u00a0treatment for retinoblastoma will depend on the stage of the tumour which can either be:\n\nintraocular\u00a0\u2013 where the cancer is completely within the eye\nextraocular\u00a0\u2013 where the cancer spreads beyond the eye to the surrounding tissue, or to another part of the body (this is rarely seen in the UK)\u00a0\n\nMost cases of retinoblastoma (9 out 10) are detected early and successfully treated before the cancer spreads outside the eyeball.\nIf the cancer has spread beyond the eye it will be more difficult to treat. However, this is rare as the condition is usually identified well before it reaches this stage.\nDepending on the size and position of the tumour, your child's specialist will be able to accurately stage the cancer into one of a number of categories (A to E).\nVisit Cancer Research UK to read\u00a0more about\u00a0retinoblastoma.\nTreating small tumours\nThere are 2\u00a0possible treatment options for treating small tumours contained within the eye. These are:\n\nlaser treatment to the eye (photocoagulation or thermotherapy)\nfreezing the tumour (cryotherapy)\n\nThese treatments are carried out under general anaesthetic, so your child will be unconscious and won't feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. In some cases, chemotherapy (see below) may be needed before or after these treatments.\nTreating larger tumours\nLarger tumours will be treated with one or a combination of the following treatments:\n\nbrachytherapy\u00a0\u2013 if the tumour isn't too large, small radioactive plates called plaques are stitched over the tumour and left in place for a few days to destroy the tumour, before being removed; radiotherapy to the whole eye may be recommended for larger tumours that haven't responded to other treatment methods\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 may be used to shrink the tumour before one of the above treatments are used, or it may be recommended if there's a\u00a0chance of the cancer spreading; in some cases, chemotherapy medication can be delivered directly to the eye\nsurgery to remove the eye \u2013 is often necessary for very large tumours where there's no sight from the eye; if your child needs to have their eye removed, they'll have an artificial eye fitted in its place\n\nSide effects of treatment\nYour child's treatment team will discuss any possible side effects of treatment with you. Different treatments have different side effects.\nSight loss\u00a0is one of the biggest worries for parents. Your child's treatment team will do everything they can to avoid your child losing their sight. If your child needs to have one of their eyes removed, the sight in their other eye won't be affected\u00a0as long as there are no tumours in the important areas for seeing in that eye.\nChildren who lose sight in one eye are usually able to adapt very quickly to using their other eye, without it affecting their home and school life. If both eyes are affected by retinoblastoma, your child will probably have some degree of sight loss, and they may need support either within a mainstream or specialist school.\nThe UK-based retinoblastoma charity, the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT), has more information about the\u00a0side effects of treatment for retinoblastoma.\nFollow-up\nRetinoblastoma requires a long period of follow-up tests, which will initially be carried out at one of the specialist retinoblastoma centres. After a period of treatment and observation, the tests will usually take place at your local eye department.\nScreening for retinoblastoma\nIf you're expecting a baby and you had retinoblastoma yourself as a child, or you have a family history of retinoblastoma, it's important to tell your GP or midwife.\nThis is because in some cases retinoblastoma is an inherited condition and babies considered at increased risk of developing it\u00a0may be offered screening after the birth.\nYour GP will be able to refer you to a specialist centre so the appropriate tests can be arranged when your baby is born. Your children's risk will depend on the type of retinoblastoma you or your relative had.\nThe aim of screening is\u00a0to identify\u00a0tumours as early as possible so that treatment can be started straight away.\nChildren under 5\u00a0years of age are usually screened by having their eyes examined while under general anaesthetic. This will be carried out at 1\u00a0of the UK's 2\u00a0specialist retinoblastoma centres\u00a0(The Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital).\nYour child will need to be screened frequently up until they're 5\u00a0years old.\nDoes my child need screening?\nThe Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) says that your child may need to be screened if:\n\nyou or your partner has had\u00a0retinoblastoma and you're expecting a baby or you've recently had a baby\nyou or your partner has had retinoblastoma and you have a child under five years of age who hasn't been checked\nyou have a child who's been diagnosed with retinoblastoma and you're expecting a baby, or you have other children under five who haven't been checked\nyour parent (or brother or sister) had retinoblastoma and you have a child under five who hasn't been checked\n\nGetting support\nThe specialist teams at the retinoblastoma centres at The Royal London Hospital and Birmingham Children's Hospital have a wealth of knowledge about retinoblastoma. You can discuss any worries or concerns you have with them.\nThey'll also be able to put you in touch with the parents of children who've recently been diagnosed with retinoblastoma and treated for it.\nThe Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) can give you further information about retinoblastoma. It also provides help and support to parents and carers of children affected by retinoblastoma, as well as adults who were affected during childhood.\u00a0You can contact them on 020 7377 5578 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm).\nYou can also call the\u00a0Cancer Research UK helpline to speak to a cancer nurse who will be able to provide you with information and support. The number is 0808 800 4040 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm).\nMacmillan operate a similar helpline\u00a0\u2013\u00a00808 808 00 00 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).\n"}, {"Name": "Retinoblastoma Children", "Information": "\nRetinoblastoma is an uncommon eye cancer that usually affects children under five, although it can affect children of any age. About 40 to 50 cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed in the UK each year. Treatment is very effective and nearly all (98 out of 100) children with retinoblastoma are cured.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nRetinoblastoma\nRetinoblastoma develops in the light-sensitive lining of the eye (called the retina).\nThere are two forms of retinoblastoma:\n\na\u00a0heritable form - this is genetic or inherited. There are often tumours in both eyes (bilateral) or sometimes only in one eye.\na\u00a0non-heritable form - this is not passed on in the family. There\u2019s one tumour in only one eye (unilateral). \u00a0\n\nCauses of retinoblastoma\nThe heritable form of retinoblastoma, which accounts for about two in every five cases, is caused by a genetic abnormality. This means that an abnormal gene allows the tumour to develop. This abnormal gene may either be inherited from a parent or happen for the first time at an early stage of development in the womb.\nGenetic counselling and support is available for families in which a member has retinoblastoma. Not all children of a parent with retinoblastoma will inherit this gene, but children born into families with a history of retinoblastoma are offered blood testing. They are also usually checked (screened) soon after birth for signs of retinoblastoma. This means that treatment can be started early if a tumour does develop.\nScreening usually starts shortly after birth and is repeated every few months for five years. An eye specialist examines the eye, while shining a light into it with an ophthalmoscope. In younger children, this may need to be done under a general anaesthetic.\nThe genetic abnormality in the heritable form of retinoblastoma is now well-understood. But we don\u2019t know what causes non-heritable retinoblastoma.\nSigns and symptoms\nSome children with a family history of retinoblastoma are picked up by screening before they have any symptoms.\nIf there\u2019s no family history of retinoblastoma, the first sign of the condition is often a white pupil that does not reflect light (leukocoria). This may be picked up when a picture of your child is taken using flash photography. The pupil of the affected eye may look white in the photograph.\nSome children may have a squint or, if the tumour is large, they may have a painful red eye.\nHow retinoblastoma is diagnosed\nTests are likely to involve an examination under anaesthetic (EUA) where an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) examines your child\u2019s eye while they\u2019re asleep. Unlike nearly all other types of cancer, retinoblastomas can be diagnosed just by their appearance. So it\u2019s not usually necessary to take a sample of tissue (a biopsy). Your child will have several more EUAs to check how treatment is progressing.\nWhen retinoblastoma is diagnosed, your child may have some other tests to check the exact position and size of the tumour, and whether it has begun to spread into surrounding structures. This is known as staging.\nThey may have some of the following tests:\n\nan ultrasound scan. This is a painless scan that uses sound waves to examine the eye and the surrounding area.\nan MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. This uses magnetism to build up a detailed picture of the eye and the head.\na\u00a0lumbar puncture. The doctor inserts a fine needle between the bones in the lower spine to remove a sample of the fluid from around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). The fluid is examined under a microscope to check whether there are any cancer cells present.\na\u00a0bone marrow sample. This may be taken to check whether there are any cancer cells in the bone marrow (where our blood cells are made). The doctor inserts a needle into the hip bone and draws some of the bone marrow out with a syringe so that it can be checked for any cancer cells.\na\u00a0bone scan. This involves taking a series of X-rays to check for signs of any spread to the bones.\na\u00a0blood test. This may be taken for genetic testing for the Rb gene. The results of this test can take some months.\n\nThe doctor or a specialist nurse will explain more about the tests that your child needs.\nStaging\nThe stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. Knowing the stage of your child\u2019s retinoblastoma helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nThe following staging system is commonly used for retinoblastoma:\nIntraocular retinoblastoma\nThere is cancer in one or both eyes, but it has not spread to other parts of the eye or the tissues surrounding the eye. This stage may be sub-divided into five grades (A\u2013E), depending on the size and position of the cancer and on whether there\u2019s any damage to the eye.\nExtraocular retinoblastoma\nThe cancer has spread outside the eye into surrounding tissue, or to other parts of the body.\nTreatment\nThis depends on the number, position and size of the tumours in the eye. The aim of treatment is to first get rid of the cancer, and secondly to try to keep the sight in the eye. Some treatments may cause changes to the vision in the affected eye. Your child\u2019s specialist will talk to you about the possible risks as well as the advantages of the treatment.\nSmaller tumours\nFor smaller tumours, treatment is given to the eye itself (called local therapy), while your child is asleep and under anaesthetic. One of the following methods may be used:\nCryotherapy\nThis is used to freeze the tumours. More than one session may be necessary, in which case they are usually done at monthly intervals.\nLaser therapy\nA laser is used to heat the tumour. Your child may need a number of sessions at intervals of 3-4 weeks.\nPlaque\nA small radioactive disc is stitched over the tumour on the outside of the eye. The disc needs to stay in place for up to four days while the radiation destroys the cancer cells. This is done for slightly larger tumours, or tumours that have not been successfully treated with other methods.\nThermotherapy\nThis process uses heat to destroy the cancer cells and may be combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as heat can improve the effectiveness of these treatments. The heat is produced by a laser, which is directed at the tumour.\nLarger tumours\nThese can be treated in a number of ways, including:\nChemotherapy\nThis is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It may be given before the local treatments mentioned above, to help shrink the tumour and make treatment more successful. Chemotherapy can also be used if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if there\u2019s a risk that it may spread. The chemotherapy drugs most commonly used to treat retinoblastoma are carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine.\nNewer techniques include giving chemotherapy directly into the artery (the blood vessel) that supplies the eye (intra-arterial chemotherapy) or injecting chemotherapy into the central gelatinous part of the eye (intra-vitreal chemotherapy).\nSurgery\nIf the tumour is very large and the vision in the eye is lost, your child is likely to need an operation to remove the eye. The specialist will only do this if it is absolutely necessary. An artificial eye is then fitted.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays from a machine to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It can be given to the whole eye but does have some effect on the surrounding tissue. Radiotherapy for retinoblastoma is normally only used when other treatments have not worked well.\nSide effects of treatment\nThe side effects will depend on the treatment your child is having. The immediate side effects will usually improve when treatment finishes. But unfortunately, some treatments may cause side effects that develop many years later. The specialist will explain all of this to you before treatment starts, and your child\u2019s follow- up will include checking for any long-term effects of treatment.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancers.\nIf appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it\u2019s right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nAt least 9 out of every 10 children with retinoblastoma are cured. Following treatment, the eye specialist will frequently examine your child\u2019s eye under anaesthetic to check that the retina is healthy, the cancer has not come back, and no new tumours have developed. Follow-up is usually in a clinic for childhood cancers, called a paediatric oncology clinic.\nChildren with heritable retinoblastoma will be given genetic counselling when they are old enough to understand it.\nHaving the heritable form of retinoblastoma means an increased risk of developing other types of cancer later in life. Your child will be followed up closely into adulthood. They will be encouraged to get any new symptoms, such as a lump, checked early, and to have a healthy lifestyle to help to reduce cancer risk.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Rhabdomyosarcoma", "Information": "\nRhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma (tumour).

There are two main types of sarcomas:\n\nsoft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels, or in any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body\nbone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton\n\nRhabdomyosarcoma\nRhabdomyosarcoma is the most common of soft tissue sarcomas in children. These tumours develop from muscle or fibrous tissue and can grow in any part of the body.\nThe most common areas of the body to be affected are around the head and neck, bladder, testes, womb, or vagina.\nSometimes tumours are also found in a muscle or a limb, in the chest or in the abdominal wall. If the tumour is in the head or neck area, it can occasionally spread into the brain or the fluid around the spinal cord.\nCauses\nThe causes of rhabdomyosarcoma are unknown but research is going on all the time. Children with certain rare genetic disorders, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, have a higher risk of developing rhabdomyosarcoma.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptom is a lump or swelling. Other symptoms will depend on the part of the body that\u2019s affected by the rhabdomyosarcoma:\n\na\u00a0tumour in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat. Occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding\na\u00a0tumour in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation)\na\u00a0tumour in the bladder may cause symptoms such as blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine\n\nHow rhabdomyosarcoma is diagnosed\nDifferent tests are usually needed to diagnose a rhabdomyosarcoma. Your child may need a small operation to remove a sample from the tumour (a biopsy) so that it can be examined under a microscope. This is usually done under a general anaesthetic.\nTests may be done to check the exact size of the tumour and to find out if it has spread to any other part of the body. These may include:\n\na chest X-ray to check the lungs\nan ultrasound\nCT or MRI scans\nblood tests and bone marrow\n\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you\nStaging\nThe \u2018stage\u2019 of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. Knowing the stage helps the doctors decide on the most effective treatment for your child.\nThe staging system for rhabdomyosarcoma is based on:\n\nwhere in the body the tumour started\nif it is in only one part of the body (localised disease), or if it has spread to another part of the body (metastatic disease).\n\nThere are different ways of staging rhabdomyosarcoma, and your child\u2019s specialist doctor will explain more about the system they are using.\nTreatment\nRhabdomyosarcomas are rare tumours and should be treated at specialist centres. Treatment will depend on the size of the tumour, its position in the body and whether it has spread.\nThe three main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Your child may have a combination of treatments.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It can be given:\n\nto shrink the tumour before surgery\nafter surgery to reduce the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma coming back\n\nThe drugs used and the length of treatment depends on the type and stage of the rhabdomyosarcoma.\nSurgery\nIf it is possible, your child will have an operation to remove all or as much as possible of the tumour, without damaging surrounding tissue or organs. The operation will depend on the size of the tumour and where it is in your body. The surgeon will explain what is involved. Chemotherapy is usually given before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with surgery. If an operation isn\u2019t possible, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are given.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It may be given after surgery to the area where the rhabdomyosarcoma started.\nSide effects of treatment\nThe side effects will depend on the treatment being given and the part of the body that is being treated. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.\nChemotherapy may cause side effects such as feeling sick, hair loss, tiredness, and an increased risk of infection. But it can also make your child feel better by relieving any symptoms the tumour is causing.\nRadiotherapy can make your child feel tired, and the skin in the area that\u2019s being treated may go red or get darker. Other side effects will depend on the area of the body that is being treated. Your child\u2019s specialist doctor or nurse will explain this.\nLate side effects\nA small number of children may develop long-term side effects many years after treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma. This depends on the type of treatment your child had. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible risk of late side effects. Follow-up for children who\u2019ve had cancer includes close monitoring for any signs of any late effects.\nLate effects may include a possible reduction in bone growth, infertility, a change in the way the heart and the kidneys work, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancer. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child.\nBefore any trial is allowed to take place, it must be approved by an ethics committee, which protects the interests of the patients taking part. If you decide to take part in a trial, your doctor or a research nurse must discuss the treatment with you so that you understand the trial and what it means for your child to take part. You may decide not to take part, or you can withdraw from a trial at any stage. You will then receive the best standard treatment available.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nAfter treatment, the doctors will regularly check your child to be sure that the cancer has not come back and there are no complications. After a while, you will not need to visit the clinic so often.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.

Fungal scalp infections (tinea capitis) are most common in children who have not reached puberty, particularly African-Caribbean children and those who live in urban areas.\nTreatment\nMost ringworm infections are mild and can be treated using a pharmacy antifungal cream. Scalp infections can be treated with antifungal tablets, sometimes combined with antifungal shampoo. If the skin is irritated or broken, it can lead to other bacterial infections, which may need treatment with antibiotics. Read more about how to treat fungal infections.\nStopping it spreading\nIt's important to prevent the infection spreading. You should avoid sharing towels, bedding or clothes with someone with a fungal infection. If you think your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. If your pet is treated quickly, you\u2019ll be less likely to catch it. If your child has a fungal infection, they can go to school, but you should inform their teacher. In addition to treatment, your child should maintain a good level of personal hygiene to prevent the infection spreading.

It also causes a\u00a0skin rash on areas where the mites have burrowed.\nRead more about the symptoms of scabies.\nScabies mites\nScabies mites are called Sarcoptes scabiei. They feed using their mouths and front legs to burrow into the outer layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs.\nAfter 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults.\nScabies like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock or breast creases.

This is known as the incubation period.\nRead more about the causes of scabies.\nScabies outbreaks\nScabies is widespread in densely populated\u00a0areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas:\n\nAfrica\nCentral and South America\nnorthern and central Australia\nCaribbean Islands\nIndia\nsoutheast Asia\n\nIn developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and\u00a0care homes.\nIn the UK, most outbreaks of scabies occur in the winter. This may be because people tend to spend more time indoors and closer to each other at this time of year.\nIt's difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the UK. This is because many people don't visit their GP and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines.\nTreating scabies\nVisit\u00a0your GP if you think\u00a0you have scabies.\u00a0It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.\nThe 2\u00a0most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and\u00a0malathion lotion (brand name Derbac M).\u00a0Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite.\nPermethrin 5% cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. Malathion 0.5% lotion is used if permethrin\u00a0is ineffective.\nIf your partner\u00a0has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearest\u00a0sexual health clinic so you can be checked\u00a0and, if necessary, treated.\nAvoid having sex and other forms of close bodily\u00a0contact until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing scabies\u00a0and treating scabies.\nComplications of scabies\nScabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching.\nCrusted scabies is a\u00a0rare but more severe form of scabies, where\u00a0a large number of\u00a0mites are in the skin.

It causes a distinctive pink-red rash.\nThe illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as group A streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat.\nGenerally, scarlet fever is much less common than it used to be but in recent years there have been a number of significant outbreaks.\nFor example, figures published by\u00a0Public Health England show that from September 2013 to March 2014 there were 2,830 cases of scarlet fever. For the same period in 2014/15 a total of 5,746 cases were recorded. The reason for recent increase is unclear.\nIt\u2019s important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of scarlet fever so that early treatment with\u00a0antibiotics can be given.\nScarlet fever symptoms\nScarlet fever usually follows a sore\u00a0throat or a skin infection, such as impetigo, caused by particular strains of streptococcus bacteria.\nInitial symptoms usually include a sore throat, headache and a high temperature (38.3C/101F or above), flushed cheeks and a swollen tongue.\nA day or two later the characteristic pinkish rash appears. It usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck.\nThe\u00a0symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop two to five days after infection, although the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as seven days.\nThe rash feels like sandpaper to touch and it may be itchy. On darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nScarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but if you think you or your child may have it, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\nYour GP should be able to diagnose scarlet fever by examining the distinctive rash and asking about other symptoms. They may also decide to take a sample of saliva from the back of the throat so it can be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.\nThere's no evidence to suggest that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. However, if you're heavily pregnant, tell the doctors and midwives in charge of your care if you've been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever.\nHow scarlet fever spreads\nScarlet fever is very contagious and can be caught by:\n\nbreathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs and sneezes\ntouching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection, such as impetigo\nsharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen\n\nIt can also be caught from carriers \u2013 people who have the bacteria in their throat or on their skin but don't have any symptoms.\nWho's affected by scarlet fever\nMost cases (about 80%) of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between two and eight years of age). However, people of any age can get the illness.\nAs it's so contagious, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by streptococcus bacteria. Outbreaks often occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another.\nThe symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins.\nIt's possible to catch scarlet fever more than once, but this is rare.\nTreating scarlet fever\nScarlet fever used to be a very serious illness, but nowadays most cases tend to be mild.\nIt can easily be treated with antibiotics. Liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin,\u00a0are often used to treat children. These must be taken for 10 days, even though most people recover after four to five days.\nIt's important to be aware that your child will still be infectious for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has begun, and therefore they shouldn't attend nursery or school during this period (see below).\nWithout antibiotic treatment, your child\u00a0will be infectious for 1-2 weeks after symptoms appear.\nRead more about treating scarlet fever.\nComplications of scarlet fever\nWith the right treatment, further problems are unlikely. However, there's a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections, such as an ear infection, sinusitis, or pneumonia.\nRead more about complications of scarlet fever.\nPreventing scarlet fever from spreading\nThere\u2019s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever.\nIf your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.\nGPs, schools and nurseries should be aware of the current high levels of scarlet fever and inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases, particularly if more than one child is affected.\nChildren and adults should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze and wash their hands with soap and water after using or disposing of tissues.\nAvoid sharing contaminated utensils, cups and glasses, clothes, baths, bed linen or towels.\n"}, {"Name": "Schizophrenia", "Information": "\nSchizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms, including:\n\nhallucinations\u00a0\u2013 hearing or seeing things that do not exist\ndelusions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0unusual beliefs not based on reality that often contradict the evidence\nmuddled thoughts based on hallucinations or delusions\nchanges in behaviour\n\nDoctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness.\u00a0This means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality.\nRead more about the symptoms of schizophrenia.\nWhy does schizophrenia happen?\nThe exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown.

Adults can also experience worsening over time of previously undiagnosed or untreated scoliosis.\nRead more\u00a0about the causes of scoliosis.\nWho is affected\nIt used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it\u2019s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well.\nIt can develop\u00a0at any age, but is most common in children aged 10-15. In the UK, around three or four in every 1,000\u00a0children\u00a0need treatment for scoliosis.\nIt's more common in females than males.\nHow scoliosis is treated\nTreatment for scoliosis depends on your age,\u00a0how severe it is, and whether it\u2019s thought it will worsen with time.\nIn very young children, treatment is not always necessary because the curvature of the spine may improve naturally as they get older. If treatment is necessary, bracing or casting may be used to attempt to halt the curve\u2019s progression.\nIf the infant or younger child's curve continues to progress despite bracing or casting, an operation may be necessary. This will usually involve inserting metal rods into the back to stabilise the spine, which are lengthened at regular intervals as your child grows.\nIn older children and adults, it is unlikely that scoliosis will improve with time, and in some it may progressively worsen.\nThe main treatments for older children are:\n\na back brace worn until they stop growing, to prevent the spine from curving further\nsurgery to correct the curvature \u2013 where the spine is straightened using rods attached to the spine by screws, hooks and/or wires\n\nIn adults, treatment primarily aims to relieve any pain. Non-surgical options, such as painkillers and exercises are often tried first, with correctional surgery seen as a last resort.\nRead more about treating scoliosis in children and treating scoliosis in adults.\nFurther problems\nScoliosis can sometimes lead to\u00a0further emotional and physical problems.\nHaving a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis.\nIf this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, such as Scoliosis Association UK. These groups are a good source of\u00a0information and support for people with scoliosis.\nIn rare cases, scoliosis can lead to physical problems if it's severe. For example, significant curvature of the spine can sometimes put increased pressure on the heart and lungs.\nRead more about the possible complications of scoliosis.\n"}, {"Name": "Septic Shock", "Information": "\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening condition that happens when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level after an infection.\nAny type of bacteria can cause the infection. Fungi such as candida and viruses can also be a cause, although this is rare.\nAt first the infection can lead to a reaction called sepsis. This begins with weakness, chills, and a rapid heart and breathing rate.\nLeft untreated, toxins produced by bacteria can damage the small blood vessels, causing them to leak fluid into the surrounding tissues.\nThis can affect your heart's ability to pump blood to your organs, which lowers your blood pressure and means blood doesn't reach vital organs, such as the brain and liver.\nPeople with a weakened immune system have an increased risk of developing septic shock.\nThis includes:\n\nnewborn babies\nelderly people\npregnant women\npeople with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes,\u00a0cirrhosis or kidney failure\npeople with lowered immune systems, such as those with\u00a0HIV or AIDS or those receiving chemotherapy\n\nSymptoms of septic shock\nSymptoms of septic shock include:\n\nlow blood pressure (hypotension) that makes you feel dizzy when you stand up\na change in your mental state, such as confusion or disorientation\ndiarrhoea\nnausea and vomiting\ncold, clammy and pale skin\n\nSeptic shock is a medical emergency.

It's caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox.\nIt's estimated that around one in every four people will have at least one episode of shingles during their life.\nSymptoms of shingles\nThe main symptom of shingles\u00a0is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy blisters,\u00a0similar in appearance to chickenpox.\u00a0New blisters may appear for up to a week, but a few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out.\nScabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring.\nThe pain may be\u00a0a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe.\u00a0You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender.\nIn some cases, shingles may cause some early symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash first appears. These early symptoms can include:\n\na\u00a0headache\nburning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area\na feeling of being generally unwell\na high temperature (fever)\n\nAn episode of shingles typically lasts around two to four weeks. It usually\u00a0affects a specific area on\u00a0one side of the body and doesn't cross over the midline of the body (an imaginary line running from between your eyes down past the belly button).\nAny part of your body can be affected, including your face and eyes, but\u00a0the chest and abdomen (tummy) are the most common areas.\nWhen to get medical advice\nShingles isn't usually serious, but see your GP as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms.\u00a0They'll usually be able to diagnose shingles based on your symptoms and the appearance of the rash.\nEarly treatment may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and the risk of developing complications.\nReferral to hospital\nIt's uncommon for someone with shingles to be referred to hospital, but your GP may consider seeking specialist advice if:\n\nthey suspect\u00a0a\u00a0complication of shingles, such as\u00a0meningitis\u00a0or\u00a0encephalitis\nshingles is affecting one of your eyes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0there's a risk\u00a0you could\u00a0develop permanent vision problems if the condition isn't treated quickly\na diagnosis isn't certain\nyou have an unusually persistent case of shingles that's not responding to treatment\nyou've been diagnosed with the condition more than twice\nyou're pregnant\nyou have a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 particularly in severe cases or cases affecting children\n\nCauses of shingles\nMost people have\u00a0chickenpox\u00a0in childhood, but after the illness has gone, the varicella-zoster virus remains dormant (inactive) in the nervous system. The immune system keeps the virus in check, but later in life it can be reactivated and cause shingles.\nIt's possible to have shingles more than once, but it's very rare to get it more than twice.\u00a0\nIt's not known exactly why the shingles virus is reactivated at a later stage in life, but most cases are thought to be caused by\u00a0having lowered immunity (protection against infections and diseases).\nThis may be the result of:\n\nold age \u2013 as you age, your immunity may decrease, and\u00a0shingles most commonly occurs in people over 70 years old\nphysical and emotional\u00a0stress \u2013 the chemicals released by your body when you're stressed can prevent your immune system working properly\nHIV and AIDS\u00a0\u2013 people with HIV are much more likely to get shingles than the rest of the population because their immune system is weak\nrecently having a bone marrow transplant\u00a0\u2013 the conditioning\u00a0you require before the transplant weakens your immune system\nrecently having an organ transplant \u2013 you may need to take medication to suppress your immune system so\u00a0your body accepts the donated organ\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 chemotherapy medication, often used to treat\u00a0cancer, can temporarily weaken your immune system\n\nHowever, young people who appear otherwise healthy can also sometimes develop shingles.\nIs shingles contagious?\nIt's not possible to catch shingles from someone with the condition or from someone with chickenpox. However, you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had\u00a0chickenpox before.\nThe blisters that form contain live virus. If a person who has never had chickenpox makes\u00a0direct contact with an open blister or something with the fluid on it,\u00a0they can contract the virus and develop chickenpox.\nPreventing the spread of the virus\nIf you have shingles, you're contagious until the last blister has dried and scabbed over. To help prevent the virus being passed on,\u00a0avoid sharing towels or flannels, swimming, or playing contact sports.\u00a0You should also avoid work or school if\u00a0your rash is weeping (oozing fluid) and can't be covered.\nChickenpox can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people. If you have shingles, avoid:\n\nwomen who are pregnant and haven't had chickenpox before as they could catch it from you, which may harm their unborn baby\npeople who have a weak immune system, such as someone with HIV or AIDS\nbabies less than one month old, unless it's your own baby, in which case your baby should have antibodies (proteins that fight infection) to protect them from the virus\n\nTreating shingles\nAlthough there's\u00a0no cure for shingles, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms until the condition resolves. Most cases of shingles last around two to four weeks.\nTreatment for shingles can include:\n\ncovering the rash with clothing or a non-adherent (non-stick) dressing to reduce the risk of other people becoming infected with chickenpox - as it's very difficult to pass the virus on to someone else if the rash is covered\npainkilling medication, - such as\u00a0paracetamol,\u00a0ibuprofen\u00a0or codeine\nantiviral medication to stop the virus multiplying -\u00a0although not everyone will need this\n\nRead more about\u00a0treating shingles\nComplications of shingles\nShingles can sometimes lead to complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia.

Click on the references at the end for more information about these conditions.\nA problem with your lungs or airways\nSudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways.\nYour GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness.\nPneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection, so you'll need to take antibiotics.\nIf you have COPD, it's likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse.\nA heart problem\nIt's possible to have a \"silent\" heart attack without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety.\nIn this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they'll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away.\nHeart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of fluid inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult.\nA combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness.\nBreathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate).\nPanic attack or anxiety\nA panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag can bring your breathing back to normal but should only be done when you are certain anxiety is the cause of your breathlessness.\nMore unusual causes\nThese include:\n\na severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)\npneumothorax \u2013 partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs\npulmonary embolism \u2013 a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \u2013 a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs\npleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung\ndiabetic ketoacidosis \u2013 a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine\n\nCauses of long-term breathlessness\nLong-term breathlessness is usually caused by:\n\nobesity or being unfit\npoorly controlled asthma\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2013 permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking\nanaemia \u2013 a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen)\nheart failure \u2013 when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly\na problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate)\n\nMore unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are:\n\nbronchiectasis \u2013 a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough\npulmonary embolism \u2013 a recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung\npartial collapse of your lung caused by lung cancer\npleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung\nnarrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body\nfrequent panic attacks, which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths)\n\n"}, {"Name": "Sickle Cell Disease", "Information": "\nSickle cell disease is the name for a group of blood disorders.

This is\u00a0found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection.\nThe\u00a0virus is spread in a similar way\u00a0to\u00a0colds and flu.\u00a0You can become infected by:\u00a0\n\ninhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection\ntouching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose\n\nSomeone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the\u00a0period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on.\nPreventing slapped cheek syndrome\nIt's very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome, because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms.\nHowever, making sure that everyone in your household washes their hands frequently may help stop the infection from spreading.\nThere's currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition.\n"}, {"Name": "Soft Tissue Sarcomas", "Information": "\nSoft tissue sarcomas are a group of rare cancers affecting the tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures and organs.\nTissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments.\nSoft tissue sarcomas can develop in almost any part of the body, including the legs, arms\u00a0and the trunk (torso).\nThere are many different types of soft tissue sarcoma, depending on where in the body they are located. For example:\n\nleiomyosarcomas \u2013 which develop in muscle tissue\nliposarcomas \u2013 which develop in fat tissue\nangiosarcomas \u2013 which develop in the cells of the blood or lymph vessels\ngastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) - which can develop in\u00a0the connective tissues that support the organs of the digestive system\n\nSoft tissue sarcomas account for around 1 in every 100 cancers diagnosed in the UK. More than 3,000 new cases are diagnosed every year.\nWhat causes soft tissue sarcomas?\nCancer develops when cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumours.\u00a0\nIn the vast majority of soft tissue sarcomas it's unclear what causes this to happen but there are a number of factors known to increase the risk, including:\n\nage \u2013 soft tissue sarcomas can occur at any age, including in children, but they are more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older\ncertain genetic conditions \u2013 some genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and retinoblastoma, are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas\nprevious radiotherapy \u2013 some people who have previously had radiotherapy for another type of cancer develop a soft tissue sarcoma, often many years after their previous treatment\nexposure to certain chemicals \u2013 exposure to some chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcomas\n\nOne particular type of soft tissue sarcoma called Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma \u2013 which develops in skin cells \u2013 is caused by a virus known as the human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV).\nSigns and symptoms\nAs soft tissue sarcomas can develop in most parts of the body, they can cause a wide range of symptoms.\nFor example, a tumour near the stomach may cause abdominal (tummy) pain, a feeling of fullness and constipation, whereas a tumour near the lungs may cause a cough or breathlessness.\nThere are often no obvious symptoms in the early stages of soft tissue sarcomas, although you may notice a soft, painless lump under your skin or deeper, that can't easily be moved around and gets bigger over time.\nYou should see your GP if you have a worrying lump or any other troublesome symptoms. A lump the size of a golf ball or larger should be regarded as suspicious and needs to be investigated urgently.\nAlthough it is much more likely you have a benign (non-cancerous) condition, it is important to get your symptoms checked out.\nDiagnosing soft tissue sarcomas\nIf your GP feels there is a possibility you do have cancer, they will refer you for a number of hospital tests to confirm whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma\u00a0and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected soft tissue sarcoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nA diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma will usually be made by a hospital specialist and will be based on your symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of:\n\na\u00a0biopsy \u2013 where a sample of suspected cancerous tissue is removed using a needle or during an operation so it can be tested and analysed in a laboratory\nimaging tests \u2013 a\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is the main type of scan carried out to assess soft tissue sarcomas, although other scans may also be carried out\n\nIf a diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma is confirmed, these tests will also help determine how far the cancer has spread (known as the 'stage') and how aggressive the cancer is (known as the 'grade').\nTreating soft tissue sarcomas\nIf you're diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma your care team of specialist doctors and nurses will help you decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nTreatment depends on factors such as the stage and grade of the cancer, the location of any tumours, and your age and general health.\nThe main treatments used are:\n\nsurgery \u2013 to remove any tumours\nradiotherapy \u2013 where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells\nchemotherapy \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells\n\nThese treatments are described in more detail below.\nSurgery\nSurgery is the main treatment for soft tissue sarcomas that are detected at an early stage.\nIt involves removing the cancerous tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. This will help ensure no cancer cells are left behind.\nEvery effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and functionality of the affected body part.\nBut there is a possibility you'll have some difficulty using the part of the body that is operated on after surgery and sometimes reconstructive plastic surgery may be needed to repair significant damage.\nIn a small number of cases, there may be no option but to amputate the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy is often used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells. This is carried out using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at a defined treatment area.\nRadiotherapy may also sometimes be used before surgery to make a tumour easier to remove, or as part of your treatment to reduce your symptoms if surgery is not possible.\nCommon side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and hair loss in the treatment area. These tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing.\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy\nChemotherapy\nLike radiotherapy, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given anti-cancer medication directly into a vein (intravenously).\nChemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be surgically removed.\nChemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body's cells, and can cause a number of temporary but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss from several parts of the body.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nOutlook\nAs with most types of cancer, the outlook for a soft tissues sarcoma depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced when it is diagnosed.\nIf the cancer is detected at an early stage and can be removed during surgery, there is a possibility it can be cured.\nBut you'll need regular check-ups following treatment to check for any signs the cancer has come back. You may also need long-term physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help you manage any physical difficulties resulting from surgery.\nA\u00a0cure is not usually possible if a soft tissue sarcoma is only detected at a late stage when it has already spread to other parts of the body, although treatment can help slow the spread of the cancer and control your symptoms.\nOverall, around half of those diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma will live at least five years from the point of their diagnosis.\nWant to know more?\n\nCancer Research UK: soft tissue sarcomas\nMacmillan: soft tissue sarcomas\nSarcoma UK: what is sarcoma?\n\n"}, {"Name": "Soft Tissue Sarcomas Teenagers And Young Adults", "Information": "\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults. It\u2019s about a type of cancer called soft tissue sarcoma.\nThere are several different types of soft tissue sarcoma. The information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas, soft tissue Ewing\u2019s sarcoma and fibrosarcomas. These are the most common types in teenagers. If you have a different type and want to know more,\u00a0contact Macmillan.\n|If you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma section.\nSoft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. There are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are:\n\nrhabdomyosarcomas\nsynovial sarcomas\nsoft tissue Ewing\u2019s sarcoma\nfibrosarcomas\n\nSarcomas can also develop in the bones. This is called osteosarcoma. You can find out more in Macmillan's bone cancer section.\nSigns and symptoms of soft tissue sarcomas\nThe symptoms of a sarcoma will depend on where it is:\n\nif it\u2019s in an arm or leg, symptoms include a lump or swelling in the limb. This is usually painless, but not always.\nif it\u2019s in the tummy (abdomen), symptoms include a painful, swollen tummy, and problems going to the toilet to poo (called constipation).\nif it\u2019s in your bladder, symptoms include pain in the lower tummy, finding it difficult to wee (pass urine), and having blood in your wee.\nif it\u2019s in the chest, symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough and pain in your chest.\nif it\u2019s in the head or neck, symptoms include a lump, a blockage and discharge from the nose or throat. Occasionally an eye may become swollen and stick out a bit.\n\nYou may also have other symptoms, such as tiredness, loss of appetite or weight loss.\nRemember - most people with the symptoms listed here won\u2019t have a sarcoma. \u00a0But if you have any of these symptoms, or are worried that you may have a sarcoma, the first thing to do is to see your GP. They'll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.\nCauses\nWe don't know what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.\nPeople often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there\u2019s no evidence for this.\nRemember that nothing you\u2019ve done has caused the cancer.\nTypes of soft tissue sarcoma\nRhabdomyosarcoma\nThis type of sarcoma grows in the active muscles of the body. These are muscles that we have control over, like the muscles we use to move our arms or legs. Rhabdomyosarcomas are most likely to happen in the head, neck, bladder, vagina, arms, legs and trunk.\u00a0\nThere are different types or rhabdomyosarcoma. The most likely one to happen in teenagers and young adults is called an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and affects an arm or a leg.\u00a0\nTo find out more look at\u00a0Macmillan's rhabdomyosarcoma\u00a0information that is written for all ages.\nSynovial Sarcoma\nThis type of sarcoma is most likely to happen in the tissue around the joints, like your elbow, knee and ankle. It can also happen in other parts of your body, but that is less common. This type of sarcoma might not be obvious straight away because the lump grows slowly and is usually not sore.\u00a0\nSoft tissue Ewing\u2019s sarcoma\nIf you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma, it's treated in the same way as a Ewing\u2019s sarcoma in a bone. You can read more about this in Macmillan's bone cancer section.\nFibrosarcoma\nThis type of sarcoma happens in the fibrous tissue in your body. Fibrous tissue joins the structures inside your body together - like your muscles to bones. You\u2019re most likely to find a fibrosarcoma on your arms, legs or trunk, but they can happen deeper in your body.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nWe also have more info about:\n\nthe\u00a0soft tissue\nhaving tests for a soft tissue sarcoma\ntreatment for a soft tissue sarcoma\u00a0\nliving with a soft tissue sarcoma\n\nIf you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, see our general\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma information.\n"}, {"Name": "Sore Throat", "Information": "\nSore throats are very common and usually nothing to worry about.

This is because the liver can take over many of the spleen's functions.\nWhat does the spleen do?\nThe spleen has a few important functions:\n\nIt fights any invading germs in the blood (the spleen contains infection-fighting white blood cells).\nIt controls the level of blood cells. The spleen controls the level of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets (small cells that form blood clots)\nIt screens the blood and removes any old or damaged red blood cells.\n\nIf the spleen doesn't work properly, it may start to remove healthy blood cells. This\u00a0can lead to:\n\nanaemia, from a reduced number of red blood cells\nan increased risk of infection, from a reduced number of white blood cells\nbleeding or bruising, from a reduced number of platelets\n\nSpleen problems\nSpleen pain\nSpleen pain is usually felt as a pain behind your left ribs. It may be tender when you touch the area.\u00a0This can be a sign of a damaged, ruptured or enlarged spleen.\nA damaged or ruptured spleen\nThe spleen can become damaged or may rupture (burst) after a forceful blow to the abdomen,\u00a0car accident, sporting accident or fracture\u00a0to the ribs.\u00a0\nRupture can happen straight away or it may happen weeks after the injury.\nSigns of a ruptured spleen are:\n\npain behind your left ribs and tenderness when you touch this area\ndizziness and a rapid heart rate (a sign of low blood pressure caused by blood loss)\n\nSometimes, if you lie down and raise your legs, the pain can be felt at the tip of your left shoulder.\nA ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, as it can cause life-threatening bleeding. Go straight to A&E if you think you've ruptured or damaged your spleen.\nEnlarged spleen\nThe spleen can become swollen after an infection or injury. It can also become enlarged as a result of a disease such as cirrhosis, leukaemia or rheumatoid arthritis.\nAn enlarged spleen doesn't always cause symptoms. Otherwise, look out for:\n\nfeeling full very quickly after eating (an enlarged spleen can press on the stomach)\nfeeling discomfort or pain behind your left ribs\u00a0\nanaemia and/or fatigue\nfrequent infections\neasy bleeding\n\nDoctors can often tell if you have an enlarged spleen by feeling your abdomen. A blood test, CT scan or MRI scan would confirm the diagnosis.\nThe spleen is not usually removed if it's just enlarged. Instead, you'll receive treatment for any underlying condition and your spleen will be monitored. Antibiotics may be prescribed if there's an infection.\nYou'll need to avoid contact sports for a while, as you'll be at greater risk of rupturing the spleen while it is enlarged.\nSurgery is only necessary if the enlarged spleen is causing serious complications or if the cause can't be found.\nSplenectomy (having the spleen removed)\nAn operation to remove the spleen, known as a splenectomy, may be needed if the spleen is damaged, diseased or enlarged.\nIt may sometimes be more appropriate to have just part of your spleen removed\u00a0\u2013 a partial splenectomy.\nIf there's time, you'll be advised to have a series of immunisations before the operation.\nLaparoscopy\nMost splenectomies are carried out using laparoscopy (keyhole surgery).\nA laparoscope is long, thin, flexible instrument with\u00a0its own light source. It is attached to a camera and\u00a0will relay high definition, magnified pictures back to a TV screen to guide the surgeon's instruments.\nLaparoscopic splenectomy allows a surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen without having to make large incisions (cuts) in your skin. However, you will still need a general anaesthetic.\nThe procedure involves:\n\nMaking several incisions in your abdomen (tummy area).\nGuiding a laparoscope into your body through one of the incisions, so doctors can see what they're doing.\u00a0\nPassing thin instruments into your abdomen through the other incisions, to remove your spleen. Gas will be pumped into your abdomen\u00a0to make this easier.\n\nThe incisions will then be stitched up or sometimes glued together.\u00a0You may be able to go home the same day, or may need to stay in hospital overnight. If you go home the same day, someone will need to stay with you for the first 24 hours.\nOpen surgery\nOpen surgery, where one large incision is made, may be needed if the spleen is too large or too damaged to be removed via keyhole surgery.\u00a0Often, in emergencies, this will be the preferred method to rapidly control bleeding.\nYou'll need a general anaesthetic and may need to stay in hospital for a few days to recover.\nAfterwards\nIt's normal to feel sore and be bruised after a splenectomy, but you'll be given pain relief medication.\nYou should be able to eat and drink as normal soon after the operation.\nLike any operation, a splenectomy carries a small risk of complications, including bleeding and infection.\nYour doctor will run through these risks with you.\nYou should be given breathing and leg movement exercises to do\u00a0at home, to reduce your risk of getting a blood clot or a chest infection.\nAnother risk is the surgical wound becoming infected. If you spot any signs of infection, contact your GP or hospital immediately, as you\u00a0may need antibiotics.\nRecovery usually takes a few weeks. Your doctor or nurse will advise when you can go back to your usual activities, such as driving.\nLiving without a spleen\nIf your spleen needs to be removed, other organs such as the liver can take over many of the spleen's functions.\u00a0\nThis means\u00a0you will still be able to cope with most infections. However, there is a small risk that a serious infection may develop quickly.\u00a0This risk will be present for the rest of your life.\nRisk of infection\nYoung children have a higher risk of serious infection than adults, but the risk is still small. The risk is also increased if you have a medical condition such as sickle cell anaemia, coeliac disease\u00a0or a condition that affects your immune system, such as HIV.\nThis risk can be minimised by following simple precautions to prevent infection.\nVaccinations\nMake sure you have had all your routine childhood vaccinations. You should also be vaccinated against:\n\npneumococcal infections such as pneumonia\nflu (get the seasonal flu jab every autumn)\u00a0\nmeningitis (MenACWY and MenB)\u00a0\n\nAntibiotics\nIt's recommended that you take low-dose antibiotics for the rest of your life to prevent bacterial infections. Antibiotics are particularly important:\n\nfor children under the age of 16\nfor the first two years after your spleen is removed\u00a0\nif your immune system doesn't work properly\n\nBe alert for signs of\u00a0infection\nWatch out for signs of infection, such as:\n\nhigh temperature (fever)\nsore throat\u00a0\ncough\nsevere headache\u00a0\nheadache with drowsiness or a rash\u00a0\nabdominal pain\u00a0\nredness and swelling around the surgical wound\n\nYour GP can prescribe a course of antibiotics for you to use if you get an infection. You should start taking them at the first sign of an infection, so see your GP as soon as possible.\nIf your infection becomes serious, you will be admitted to hospital.\nAnimal and tick bites\nBites from animals and ticks (small blood-sucking parasites) can cause infections.\nIf you get bitten by an animal, particularly a dog, start your course of antibiotics and seek medical advice urgently.\nIf you go trekking or camping regularly, you may be at risk of babesiosis, which is a rare disease transmitted by ticks. Try to avoid tick bites by wearing clothes that cover your skin, particularly long trousers. If you become ill, get medical advice straight away.\nTelling medical staff about your condition\nHealthcare professionals will mark your health records to show that you don't have a working spleen. However, always remember to tell any medical professionals that you see, including your dentist.\nCarry medical ID\nIt's a good idea to carry or wear some medical ID. For example:\n\nif your spleen is removed, the hospital may give you a splenectomy card to take home with you\nyou may want to buy your own medical ID, such as a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag bracelet or pendant\u00a0\n\nIf you need help or emergency treatment, your medical ID will alert the staff to your condition.\nTravel abroad\nIf you're travelling abroad:\n\nyou may be advised to take a course of antibiotics with you\nfind out if you need an extra meningitis vaccination (types ACWY)\u00a0\ncheck if you need any travel vaccinations\u00a0\n\nPeople without a working spleen have an increased risk of developing a severe form of malaria. If possible, avoid countries where malaria is present. If you can't, speak to your GP or local pharmacist about\u00a0anti-malaria medicine before you travel. You should also use mosquito nets and insect repellent.\u00a0\nScars\nThe scars from your operation will gradually fade.\n\n\u00a0\n"}, {"Name": "Stillbirth", "Information": "\nA stillbirth is when a baby dies after the 24th week of a pregnancy or during birth.\nIt\u2019s a devastating experience for parents and can affect you and your family in ways you don\u2019t expect.\nHow you might be feeling\nYour emotions will likely be in turmoil and you might feel angry, guilty, sad and lonely but also love and pride.

You might want to involve other members of your family too.\nIf you\u2019re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide. Many parents find it comforting to see, touch and hold their baby and, if you want to, you can bath and dress them.\nCuddle cot\nYour midwife can talk to you about a Cuddle Cot, a special cooling mattress inside a cot which can let you spend more time with your baby in the hospital or at home.\nThis gives you more time to say goodbye, with the support of family and friends.\nIf the hospital doesn\u2019t have a Cuddle Cot then there are other organisations that can organise one for bereaved parents. Ask your midwife.\nAfter a stillbirth\nWhat you choose to do is very personal and individual, as is the way you grieve.\nSpecialist help and support is available for parents and families who have lost a baby and your midwife, family nurse and health visitor can help you to find the right support locally.\nRegistering a stillbirth\nYour baby\u2019s stillbirth must be registered. Your midwife and the hospital staff can advise you how to do this.\nYou can\u2019t officially register a baby lost before 24 weeks of pregnancy, but some hospitals will give you a certificate in memory of your baby if you ask.\nMore about registering the death of a baby\nFuneral arrangements\nYou\u2019ll need time to think what you\u2019d like for your baby\u2019s funeral. This could be a burial or cremation with a service in the style of your choice. Take as much time as you need to decide on the right way to say goodbye.\nAll hospitals in Scotland will offer a funeral service for your baby free of charge or you may choose to make your own private arrangements, which can give you more choice and control.\nMore about funeral arrangements\nCoping with the loss of a baby\nEveryone reacts differently to the loss of a baby. Your emotions might be overwhelming and you might feel physically drained too.\nTake time to rest and look after yourself. It\u2019s important to know you are not alone and have done nothing wrong.\nMore about coping with the loss of a baby\nPost-mortem\nIf you lost your baby after 13 weeks, you'll be offered a post-mortem (autopsy). This is a medical investigation to try to understand what happened and find out if there are issues that could affect a future pregnancy\nWhether or not to have a post-mortem can be a difficult decision and you\u2019ll be given support and time to think it over. If you have questions or worries, ask the person who discusses the post-mortem with you.\nRecovering from a stillbirth\nYou will need care from your midwife and doctor to make sure your body is recovering. Your midwife will assist you through all the decisions you need to make and help you to find the right support.\nYou don\u2019t have to manage alone and it can sometimes help to talk with others who have been through baby loss. You, your baby\u2019s father or your partner and your family are likely to need time to grieve.\nRemembering your baby\nSome parents find it helps to do something to remember their baby, like:\n\ncreating a space in their garden\nsaying a prayer\nwriting a poem\n\nOthers keep photographs, handprints or footprints, or locks of their baby's hair in a memory box. No matter what stage of pregnancy your loss is, you can make a memory box \u2013 ask your midwife about this. Some hospitals give special boxes to parents just for this.\nSome parents don\u2019t want to do any of these things, and that\u2019s okay too.

Around 2,200 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year\u00a0in the UK.\nTesticular cancer is unusual compared to other cancers because it tends to affect younger men. Although it's relatively uncommon overall, testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect men between the ages of 15 and 49.\nFor reasons that are unclear,\u00a0white men have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer compared with men from other ethnic groups.\nThe number of cases of testicular cancer that are diagnosed each year in the UK has roughly doubled since the mid-1970s. Again, the reasons for this are unclear.\nCauses of testicular cancer\nThe exact cause or causes of testicular cancer are unknown, but a number of factors have been identified that increase a man's risk of developing it. The 3 main risk factors are described below.\nUndescended testicles\nUndescended testicles\u00a0(cryptorchidism) is the most significant risk factor for testicular cancer.\nAbout 3-5% of boys are born with their testicles inside their abdomen. They usually descend into the scrotum during the first year of life, but in some boys the testicles don't descend.\u00a0\nIn most cases, testicles\u00a0that don't descend by the time a boy is 1 year old descend\u00a0at a later stage. If the testicles don't descend naturally,\u00a0an operation known as an\u00a0orchidopexy can be carried out to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum.\nIt's important that undescended testicles move down into the scrotum during early childhood because boys with undescended testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer than boys\u00a0whose testicles descend normally. It's also much easier to observe the testicles when they're in the scrotum.\nMen with undescended testicles are about 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer than men whose testicles descend at birth or shortly after.\nFamily history\nHaving a close relative with a history of testicular cancer or an undescended testicle increases your risk of also developing it.\nFor example, if your father had testicular cancer, you're around 4 times more likely to develop\u00a0it than someone with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you're about 8 times more likely to develop it.\nCurrent research suggests a number of genes may be involved\u00a0in the development of testicular cancer\u00a0in families where more than one person has had the condition. This is an ongoing area of research\u00a0in which patients and their families may be asked to take part.\nPrevious testicular cancer\nMen who've previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are between 4 to 12 times more likely to develop it in the other testicle.\nFor this reason,\u00a0if you've previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer, it's very important that you keep a close eye on the other testicle.\nIf you've been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you also need to be observed for signs of recurrence for between 5 and 10 years, so it's very important that you attend your follow-up appointments.\nCancer Research UK has more information about testicular cancer risks and causes.\nOutlook\nTesticular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer, and the outlook is one of the best for cancers.\nIn England and Wales, almost all men (99%) survive for a year or more after being diagnosed with testicular cancer, and 98% survive for 5 years or more after diagnosis.\nCancer Research UK has more information about survival rates for testicular cancer.\nAlmost all men who are treated for testicular germ cell tumours are cured, and it's rare for the condition to return more than 5 years later.\nTreatment almost always includes the surgical removal of the affected testicle \u2013 called orchidectomy or orchiectomy \u2013 which doesn't usually affect fertility or the ability to have sex.\nIn some cases,\u00a0chemotherapy or, less commonly,\u00a0radiotherapy may be used for seminomas (but not non-seminomas).\nRead more about treating testicular cancer.\n"}, {"Name": "Testicular Cancer Teenagers And Young Adults", "Information": "\nIt can be embarrassing to talk about your testicles and any changes to them that you\u2019ve noticed.

Some of the main causes are:\n\nvaricoceles \u2013\u00a0swellings caused by swollen and enlarged veins within the\u00a0scrotum\nhydroceles \u2013\u00a0swellings caused by a build-up of fluid around the testicle\u00a0\nepididymal cysts \u2013\u00a0lumps caused by a collection of fluid in the epididymis (a coiled tube behind the testicles)\nepididymo-orchitis \u2013 inflammation of the epididymis and testicles\ninguinal hernias \u2013\u00a0where fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin, which can cause the scrotum to become enlarged\n\nA sudden and severely painful swelling in one of your testicles can be a sign of a condition called testicular torsion, which is where the blood supply to a testicle is interrupted.\nIn rare cases, testicular lumps can be a sign of testicular cancer. Cancer Research UK estimates that fewer than four in every 100 testicular lumps are cancerous.\nRead more about the causes of testicular lumps and swellings\nSeeing your GP\nYou should see your GP if you notice any lumps, swellings or changes in your testicles.\nYour GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine your testicles to try to identify the cause of the problem.\nIn some cases you may be referred for further tests, such as an ultrasound scan of your scrotum, to confirm a diagnosis.\nIf you experience sudden or severe pain in your testicles, it's important to contact your GP immediately or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible because urgent treatment may be required.\nRead more about diagnosing testicular lumps and swellings\n\n"}, {"Name": "Thirst", "Information": "\nFeeling thirsty all the time and for no good reason isn't normal and should be investigated by your GP.\nThirst is normally just\u00a0the brain's way of warning that you're dehydrated because you're not drinking enough fluid. But\u00a0excessive and persistent thirst (known as\u00a0polydipsia) could be a sign of\u00a0an underlying problem such as diabetes.\nCommon causes of thirst\nDehydration\nYou will usually feel thirsty because you're not\u00a0drinking the amount of fluid your body needs. This may be because you've been sweating heavily or you've lost fluid because you have diarrhoea\u00a0and are vomiting.\nYou can soon quench your thirst and restore the fluid balance in your body by having a drink and ensuring you remain well hydrated.\nIt's\u00a0particularly important to stay well hydrated\u00a0during hot weather, while exercising and while you're unwell with vomiting and diarrhoea.\u00a0\nFood\nIn some cases, thirst may be caused by something as simple as a recent meal or snack. Eating\u00a0salty or spicy foods can cause you to suddenly feel thirsty.\nDiabetes\nIf you feel thirsty all the time, it could be a sign of diabetes\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you also have other symptoms such as needing to urinate frequently, extreme tiredness (fatigue) and\u00a0unexplained weight loss.\nDiabetes is a lifelong condition that makes it difficult to control the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. The high levels of glucose can mean your kidneys need to produce more urine to help pass the glucose out of your body. This can make you feel thirsty because your brain is telling you to drink more to make up for the fluids you've lost.\nIf you feel thirsty all the time and have other symptoms, your GP will probably carry out a blood glucose test to see whether you have diabetes.\nPregnancy\nFeeling thirsty, as well as urinating more often than usual, is a common symptom in pregnancy and usually nothing to worry about.\u00a0\nVery occasionally, these problems can be a sign of gestational diabetes (a type of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy). You should be screened for this as part of your antenatal care if you're at risk.\nMedication\nExcessive thirst can\u00a0sometimes be a side effect of certain types of medication, including lithium, certain antipsychotics and diuretics (water tablets).\nIf you think a particular medicine is causing your thirst, it may be possible to change to a different medicine or reduce your dose. Speak to your GP about this.\nOther causes of thirst\nThere are also many other potential causes of severe thirst. These include:\n\ndiabetes insipidus \u2013 a condition caused by problems with a hormone that regulates the amount of fluid in the body\ndiabetic ketoacidosis \u2013 a dangerous complication of diabetes caused by a lack of the hormone insulin in the body\nsickle cell aneamia \u2013 an inherited blood disorder\npsychogenic polydipsia \u2013 where a person with a mental health condition, such as schizophrenia, drinks excessive amounts of water that can't be excreted (got rid of) by the kidneys\nexcessive bleeding\n\n"}, {"Name": "Threadworms", "Information": "\nThreadworms, also known as pinworms, are tiny parasitic worms that infect the large intestine of humans.\nThreadworms\u00a0are a common type of\u00a0worm\u00a0infection in the UK, particularly in children under the age of\u00a010.\nThe worms\u00a0are white and look like small pieces of thread.

Both men and women can get thrush, though it is more often associated with women.\nThe medical term for thrush is candidiasis.\nWhat it looks like\nIn men, it usually affects the head of the penis \u2013 causing irritation, discharge and redness.\u00a0\nRead more about the symptoms of thrush\nIt can also affect the skin, known as candidal skin infection, and the inside of the mouth, known as oral thrush.\nShould I see a doctor?\nIf you suspect thrush for the first time, it's best to see a doctor for a diagnosis. This is because the symptoms can be similar to those of a\u00a0sexually transmitted infection (STI). Your GP will be able to tell the difference.\nIf you've had thrush before and you recognise the symptoms, you can treat it yourself with over-the-counter medication.\nYou should also visit your GP if you have a weakened immune system and you have thrush.\u00a0This is because there is a risk that a thrush infection could progress to a more serious case of invasive candidiasis. Read our page on the\u00a0complications of thrush for more information about invasive candidiasis.\nTreating and\u00a0preventing\u00a0thrush\nYou can treat thrush without prescription medications. For thrush affecting your\u00a0penis, ask your\u00a0chemist for clotrimazole cream or a\u00a0tablet called fluconazole. For thrush infections in your groin or elsewhere, the chemist can supply a cream.\nIt's possible for thrush to spread during sex, but it's not an STI.\u00a0However, both sexual partners may need thrush treatment to prevent re-infection. Re-infection from a female partner is common. Seek advice from a pharmacist or your GP.\nHowever, not all cases are caused by sex, and many cases develop in men and women who are not sexually active.\nRead more about\u00a0treating thrush\nYou can help prevent thrush by\u00a0cleaning your penis regularly and using a condom while having sex with your partner (if they have thrush).\nAvoid using perfumed soaps or shower gels on your genitals, as they can cause irritation. Make sure you dry your penis properly after washing.\nWearing loose-fitting cotton underwear can help prevent moisture building up under your foreskin, which lowers the chances of the candida fungus multiplying.\u00a0\nWhat causes thrush?\nThe fungus candida albicans occurs naturally in\u00a0your body, particularly in warm, moist areas, such as inside the mouth and around the genitals.\nIt does not usually cause problems because it is kept under control by\u00a0your immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence against illness and infection) and other types of bacteria in the body.\nHowever,\u00a0certain conditions can cause the fungus to multiply and lead to infection.

Its main purpose is to release hormones (chemicals that have powerful effects on many different functions of the body).\nThe thyroid gland releases 3\u00a0separate hormones:\n\ntriiodothyronine \u2013\u00a0known as T3\nthyroxine \u2013\u00a0known as T4\ncalcitonin\n\nThe T3 and T4 hormones help regulate the body's metabolic rate (the rate at which the various processes in the body work, such as how quickly calories are burnt).\nAn excess of\u00a0T3 and T4 will make you feel overactive and you\u00a0may lose weight. If you don't have enough of these hormones, you'll feel sluggish and you\u00a0may gain weight.\nCalcitonin helps control blood calcium levels. Calcium is a mineral that performs a number of important functions, such as building strong bones.\nCalcitonin isn't essential for maintaining good health because your body also has other ways of controlling calcium.\nTypes of thyroid cancer\nThere are 4\u00a0main types of thyroid cancer. They are:\n\npapillary carcinoma \u2013 this is the most common type, accounting for about 6 out of 10\u00a0(60%) cases; it usually affects people under the age of 40, particularly women\nfollicular carcinoma \u2013 accounts for around\u00a03 out of 20 (15%) cases of thyroid cancer and tends to affect older adults\nmedullary thyroid carcinoma \u2013 accounts for between 5 and 8 out of every 100 diagnosed cases (5-8%); unlike the other types of thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma\u00a0can run in families\u00a0\nanaplastic thyroid carcinoma \u2013 this is the rarest and most aggressive type of thyroid cancer, accounting for less than 1\u00a0in 20 thyroid cancers; it usually affects older people over the age of 60\u00a0\n\nPapillary and follicular carcinomas are sometimes known as differentiated thyroid cancers, and they're often treated in the same way.\nHow common is thyroid cancer?\nThyroid cancer is a rare form of cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cancer cases in the UK. Each year, around 2,700 people are diagnosed with thyroid cancer in the UK.\nIt's most common in people aged 35 to 39 years and in those aged 70 years or over.\nWomen are 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. It's unclear why this is, but it may be\u00a0a result of\u00a0the hormonal changes associated with the female reproductive system.\nWhat causes thyroid cancer?\nIn most cases, the cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.\nRisk factors for thyroid cancer include:\n\nhaving a benign (non-cancerous) thyroid condition\nhaving a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer)\nhaving a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis\nacromegaly\u00a0\u2013 a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone\nhaving a previous benign (non-cancerous) breast condition\nweight and height\nradiation exposure\u00a0\n\nRead more about the causes of thyroid cancer\nDiagnosing thyroid cancer\nA\u00a0type of blood test known as a thyroid function test\u00a0will measure the hormone levels in your blood and rule out or confirm other thyroid problems.\nIf nothing else seems to be causing the lump in your thyroid, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is used.\nFurther testing may be required if the FNAC results are inconclusive, or if more information is needed to make your treatment more effective.\nRead more about how thyroid cancer is diagnosed.\nTreating thyroid cancer\nYour\u00a0recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether a complete cure is realistically achievable.\nDifferentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs)\u00a0are treated using a combination of surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) and a type of\u00a0radiotherapy that destroys any remaining cancer cells and prevents the thyroid cancer returning.\nMedullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than DTCs, so it may be necessary to remove any nearby lymph nodes, as well as your thyroid gland.\nRead more about treating thyroid cancer\nRecurrence\nCancerous cells will return\u00a0in an estimated 5-20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer. In approximately 10-15% of people, the cancerous cells will come back in other parts of their body, such as their bones.\nCancerous cells can sometimes\u00a0return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.\u00a0\nYou'll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that return can be treated quickly.\u00a0\nRead more about the complications of thyroid cancer\nPreventing thyroid cancer\nFrom the available evidence, eating a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer.\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least\u00a0five portions a day) and whole grains.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for differentiated thyroid cancers is very good. Most people (80-90%) will have a normal lifespan.\nPapillary and follicular carcinomas tend to be slow growing and relatively straightforward to treat.\nMore than 9 out of 10 people with papillary carcinoma will live for 10 or more years after diagnosis. More than 8 out of 10 people with follicular thyroid cancer will live for at least 10 years after being diagnosed.\nMedullary thyroid carcinoma is harder to treat. It doesn't respond to iodine treatment, so removing all of the cancerous cells can be difficult.\nSurvival rates for medullary thyroid carcinoma depend on the stage of the cancer when it was diagnosed. If diagnosed in its early stages, 97% of people live at least 5\u00a0years after diagnosis.\nIf medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed after it has spread to other parts of the body, 1 in 4 people live at least 5\u00a0years after diagnosis.\nBecause of\u00a0its aggressive nature, less than 1 in 10 people with\u00a0anaplastic thyroid carcinoma\u00a0will live at least 5\u00a0years after being diagnosed.\n"}, {"Name": "Thyroid Cancer Teenagers And Young Adults", "Information": "\nThis section is for teens and young adults.

But having these doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get cancer.\nGenes\nGenes are the biological information in each cell that we inherit from our parents. Genes affect the way we look (for example, our eye colour) and how our bodies grow and work. Some rare genetic conditions that run in families can increase the risk of thyroid cancer. But fewer than 1 in 10 cases of cancer are caused by an inherited faulty gene.\nRadiotherapy\nIf you were exposed to radiation or had\u00a0radiotherapy treatment to the neck area when you were younger, you may be at a higher risk of developing thyroid cancer many years later.\nIf you're worried about thyroid cancer\nIf you think you might have some of these symptoms you should go straight to your GP.

Typical signs of a bacterial infection include white pus-filled spots on\u00a0the tonsils, no cough and swollen\u00a0or tender lymph glands.\nIf you develop severe tonsillitis as a teenager or adult, your GP may recommend a\u00a0blood test\u00a0for glandular fever.\nThe tonsils\nThe tonsils are two small glands that sit on either side of the throat. In young children, they help to fight\u00a0germs and act as a barrier against infection.\nWhen the tonsils become infected, they isolate the infection and stop it spreading further into the body.\nAs a child's\u00a0immune system develops and gets stronger, the tonsils become less important and usually shrink. In most people, the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils.\nRemoval of the\u00a0tonsils\u00a0is usually only recommended if they're causing problems, such as severe or repeated episodes of tonsillitis (see below).\nWhat causes tonsillitis?\nMost cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as the viruses that cause the common cold or flu virus (influenza).\nSome cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria.\nThese types of infections spread easily, so it's important to try to avoid passing the infection on to others by:\n\nstaying away from public places, such as work, school or nursery, until your GP says it's safe to return (usually after the symptoms have passed)\ncoughing and sneezing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue\u00a0\nwashing hands before eating, after going to the toilet and, if possible, after coughing and sneezing\n\nRead more about the causes of tonsillitis.\nTreating tonsillitis\nThere's no specific treatment for tonsillitis, but you may be able to reduce the symptoms by:\n\ntaking paracetamol\u00a0or\u00a0ibuprofen to help relieve pain\ndrinking plenty of fluids\ngetting plenty of rest\n\nIf test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, a short course of oral antibiotics may be prescribed.\nIf oral antibiotics aren't effective at treating bacterial tonsillitis, intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed in hospital.\nChronic tonsillitis\nIn most cases, tonsillitis gets better within a week. However, a small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer, or it keeps returning. This is known as chronic tonsillitis and surgical treatment may be needed.\nSurgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended\u00a0if:\n\nyou've had several severe episodes of tonsillitis over a long period of time\nrepeated episodes are disrupting normal activities\n\nRead more about treating tonsillitis.\nComplications of tonsillitis\nComplications of tonsillitis are rare and usually only occur if it's caused by a bacterial infection.

They may apply a fluoride gel, varnish or paste\u00a0to the area. Fluoride\u00a0helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay.\nYour dentist may discuss\u00a0a filling or crown with you \u2013 this involves removing the dental decay, offering\u00a0local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and filling the hole\nIf tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) \u2013 this may be removed in a process known as\u00a0root canal treatment.\nIf the tooth is so badly damaged that it can't be restored \u2013 it may need to be removed. Your dentist may\u00a0be able to\u00a0replace the tooth with a partial denture, bridge or implant.\n\nCost of NHS treatment\nNHS charges are set by the government and are standard for all NHS patients. Charges are assessed each year and usually change every April.\nSome people don't have to pay for dental treatment, including children, pregnant women\u00a0and new mothers.\u00a0Financial help may also be available to those on a low income.\nThe cost of private dental treatment varies between practices, as there is no set charge. If you choose to see a private dentist, make sure to agree the cost before having treatment.\nPreventing tooth decay\nAlthough tooth decay is a\u00a0common problem, it's often entirely preventable. The best way to avoid tooth decay is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. For example, you should:\n\nvisit your dentist regularly \u2013 your dentist will decide how often they need to see you based on the condition of your mouth, teeth and gums\ncut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks, particularly between meals or within an hour of going to bed \u2013 some medications can also contain sugar, so it's best to look for sugar-free alternatives where possible\nlook after your teeth and gums \u2013 brushing your teeth properly with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day, using floss and an interdental brush at least once a day\navoid smoking or drinking alcohol\u00a0excessively \u2013 tobacco can interfere with saliva production, which helps to keep your teeth clean,\u00a0and alcohol can contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel\nsee your dentist or GP\u00a0if you have a persistently dry mouth\u00a0\u2013 this may be caused by certain medicines, treatment or medical conditions\n\nRead:\nhow to keep your teeth clean\nreading food labels\u00a0\nProtecting your child's teeth\nEstablishing good eating habits by limiting sugary snacks and drinks\u00a0can help your child avoid tooth decay. Regular visits to the dentist at an early age should also be encouraged.\nIt's important to teach your child how to clean their teeth properly and regularly. Your dentist\u00a0can\u00a0show\u00a0you how to do this. Younger children should use a children's toothpaste, but make sure to read the label about how to use it.\u00a0\nChildren should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime.\n\u00a0\nHow plaque causes tooth decay\nYour mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque.\nWhen you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates \u2013 particularly sugary foods and drinks \u2013 the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time.\nIf the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities.\nOnce cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). As the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up.\nWithout treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). At this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your tooth painful.\nThe bacteria can cause a dental abscess in the pulp and the infection could spread into the bone, causing another type of abscess.\n"}, {"Name": "Toothache", "Information": "\nToothache refers to pain in and around the teeth and jaws that's usually caused by tooth decay.\nYou may feel toothache in many ways. It can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold.\nThe pain can also be mild or severe. It may feel \"sharp\" and start suddenly. It can be worse at night, particularly when you're lying down. A lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain.\nIt can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. When a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it's coming from the ear.\nToothache in other upper teeth may feel like it's coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead.\nThe area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch.\nIt's also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a \"dull\" pain. Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth.\nWhen to see your dentist\nIf you have toothache for more than one or two days, visit your dentist as soon as possible to have it treated. The longer you leave it, the worse it will get.\nIf your toothache isn't treated, the pulp inside your tooth will eventually become infected. This can usually lead to a dental abscess, with severe and continuous throbbing pain.\nPainkillers, such as\u00a0paracetamol and ibuprofen, may reduce the pain and discomfort while you're waiting for an appointment.\u00a0Children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin.\nFind a dentist near you.\nWhat causes toothache?\nToothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of\u00a0sensitive nerves and blood vessels.\nDental pulp can become inflamed as a result of:\n\ntooth decay\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this leads to holes (cavities) forming in the hard surface of the tooth\na cracked tooth \u2013\u00a0the crack\u00a0is often so small that it can't be seen with the naked eye\nloose or broken fillings\nreceding gums \u2013\u00a0where the gums shrink\u00a0(contract) to expose softer, more sensitive parts of the tooth root\nperiapical abscess\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a collection of pus at the end of the tooth caused by a bacterial infection\n\nThere are a number of other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn't affected. These include:\n\nperiodontal abscess\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a collection of pus in the gums caused by a bacterial infection\nulcers on your gums\nsore or swollen gums around a tooth that's breaking through \u2013 for example, when your\u00a0wisdom teeth start to come through\u00a0\nsinusitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which sometimes causes pain around the upper jaw\nan injury to the joint that attaches the jaw to the skull (temporomandibular joint)\n\nBabies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. This is known as teething.\nTreating toothache\nThe type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain, so your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out an X-ray\u00a0to try to identify the problem.\nIf your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling.\nIf your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place.\nIf\u00a0the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. This procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection.\nYour tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can't be treated using these methods or\u00a0the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted).\nPreventing toothache\nThe best way to\u00a0avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should:\n\nlimit your intake of sugary foods and drinks\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you should have these\u00a0as an occasional treat and only at mealtimes; read more about cutting down on sugar\nbrush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that contains fluoride\u00a0\u2013 gently brush your gums and tongue as well\nclean between your teeth using dental floss and, if necessary, use a mouthwash\u00a0\ndon't smoke\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it can make some dental problems worse\n\nMake sure you have regular dental check-ups,\u00a0preferably with the same dentist.\u00a0\nThe time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems.\nYour dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health.\nChildren should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early.\nRead more about\u00a0taking care of your teeth and keeping your teeth clean.\n"}, {"Name": "Transient Ischaemic Attack Tia", "Information": "\nA transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or \"mini stroke\" is caused by a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.\nThe disruption in blood supply results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. This can cause sudden symptoms similar to those of a stroke, such as speech and visual disturbance, and numbness or\u00a0weakness in the face, arms and legs.\nHowever, a TIA does not last as long as a stroke.\u00a0The effects often only last for a few minutes or hours and fully resolve within 24 hours.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe main symptoms of a TIA\u00a0can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time.\n\nFace \u2013 the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped.\nArms \u2013 the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm.\nSpeech \u2013 their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all, despite appearing to be awake.\nTime \u2013 it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms.\n\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of a TIA\nSeeking medical advice\nIn the early stages of a TIA, it's not possible to tell whether you are having a TIA or a full stroke, so it's important to phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\nEven if the symptoms disappear while you are waiting for the ambulance to arrive, an assessment in hospital should still be carried out.\nA TIA is a warning that you are at risk of having a full stroke in the near future, and an assessment can help doctors to determine the best way to reduce the chances of this happening.\nIf you think you may have had a TIA previously, but the symptoms have since passed and you didn't seek medical advice at the time, you should make an urgent appointment with your GP so they can determine whether to refer you for a hospital assessment.\nRead more about diagnosing a TIA\nWhat causes TIAs?\nDuring a TIA, one of the blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked.\nThis blockage is usually caused by a\u00a0blood clot\u00a0that has formed elsewhere in your body and travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain, although it can also be caused by pieces of fatty material or air bubbles.\nCertain things can increase your chances of having a TIA, including:\n\nsmoking\nhaving\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension)\nbeing\u00a0obese\nhaving\u00a0high cholesterol levels\nregularly drinking an excessive amount of alcohol\nhaving\u00a0atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat)\nhaving\u00a0diabetes\n\nPeople over 60 years of age, and\u00a0people of\u00a0Asian, African or Caribbean descent are also at a higher risk of having a TIA.\nRead more about the causes of TIA\nHow TIAs are treated\nAlthough the symptoms of a TIA resolve in a few minutes or hours, you will need treatment to help prevent another TIA or a full stroke\u00a0happening\u00a0in the future.\nYour\u00a0treatment will depend on your individual circumstances, such as your age and medical history.\nYou are likely to be\u00a0given advice\u00a0about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce\u00a0your stroke risk (see below), in addition to being offered medication to treat the underlying cause of your TIA.\nIn some cases,\u00a0surgery may be needed\u00a0to unblock the carotid arteries (the main blood vessels that supply the brain with blood).\nRead more about treating a TIA\nPreventing TIAs\nA\u00a0TIA\u00a0is often\u00a0a sign that another one may follow and you are at a high risk of having a full, life-threatening stroke in the near future.\nRegardless of whether or not you have had a TIA or stroke in the past,\u00a0there are a number of ways you can lower your risk of having either in the future.

Very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time.\nPeople with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. In severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day.\nIt's possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. Some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks.\nTypically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. Sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever.\nLiving with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression.\nRead more about the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as\u00a0paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.\nYour GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain.\nHowever, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult, and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed.\nRead more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia\nWhat causes trigeminal neuralgia?\nIn the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain.\nThis compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull.\nIn rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such as\u00a0multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour.\nRead more about the causes of trigeminal neuralgia\nWho is affected\nIt's not clear exactly how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but the condition is thought to be rare.\nSome studies have suggested that around 27 in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year, although this figure is probably too high as the condition tends to be over-diagnosed by doctors. Other estimates have suggested that there are about 6,500 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK.\nThe condition affects women more often than men and is rare in people under the age of 40, although it can occur in younger people. Most cases are first seen in people between the ages of 50 and 60.\nHow trigeminal neuralgia is treated\nTrigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition, and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. However, most cases can be controlled to at least some degree with treatment.\nThe first treatment offered will usually be with an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat\u00a0epilepsy) called carbamazepine. To be effective, this medication needs to be taken several times a day, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so that high enough levels of the medication can build up in your bloodstream.\nUnless your pain starts to diminish or disappears altogether, the medication is usually continued for as long as is necessary, sometimes for many years. If you are entering a period of remission and your pain goes away, stopping the medication should always be done slowly over days or weeks, unless you are advised otherwise by a doctor.\nCarbamazepine was not originally designed to treat pain, but it can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages.\nIf this medication is ineffective, unsuitable or causes too many side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medications or surgical procedures that may help.\nThere are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia \u2013 usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals \u2013 but these are generally only effective for a few years.\nAlternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open up your skull and move away any blood vessels compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results in terms of long-term pain relief, but it is a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as\u00a0hearing loss,\u00a0facial numbness or, very rarely, a stroke.\nRead more about treating trigeminal neuralgia\n"}, {"Name": "Tuberculosis Tb", "Information": "\nTuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.\nIt is a serious\u00a0condition, but can be cured with proper treatment.\nTB mainly affects the lungs.

For example,\u00a0it often spreads within a family who live in the same house.\nIn most healthy people, the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) kills the bacteria, and you have no symptoms.\nSometimes\u00a0the immune system cannot kill the bacteria, but manages to prevent it spreading in the body. This means you will not have any symptoms, but the bacteria will remain in your body. This is known as \"latent TB\".\u00a0\nIf\u00a0the immune system fails to kill or contain the infection, it can spread within the lungs or other parts of the body and symptoms will develop within a few weeks or months. This is known as \"active TB\".\nLatent TB could develop into an active TB infection at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened.\nRead more about the causes of TB\nWho is affected?\nBefore antibiotics were introduced, TB was a major health problem in the UK. Nowadays, the condition is much less common.\nHowever, in the last 20 years, TB cases have gradually increased, particularly among ethnic minority communities who are originally from countries where TB is more common.\nIn 2014, more than 6,500 cases of TB were reported in England. Of these, around 4,700 affected people who were born outside the UK.\nIt's estimated that around one-third of the world's population is infected with latent TB. Of these, up to 10% will become active at some point.\nHow TB is treated\nWith treatment, TB can usually be cured. Most people will need a course of antibiotics, usually for six months.\nSeveral different antibiotics are used. This is because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics. If you are infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with six or more different medications may be needed.\nIf you are in close contact with someone who has TB, tests may be carried out to see if you are also infected. These can include a chest X-ray,\u00a0blood tests, and a skin test called the Mantoux test.\nRead more about\u00a0treating TB\nTuberculosis vaccination\nThe\u00a0BCG\u00a0vaccine\u00a0can\u00a0provide effective protection against TB in up to\u00a08 out of 10\u00a0people\u00a0who are given it.\nCurrently, BCG vaccinations are only recommended for groups of people who are at a higher risk of developing TB.\nThis includes children living in areas with high rates of TB, or those who have close family members from countries with high TB rates, and\u00a0people under the age of 16\u00a0who are going to live and work with local people in an area with high rates of TB\u00a0for more than three months.\nIt's also recommended that some people, such as healthcare workers, are vaccinated\u00a0because of\u00a0the increased risk of contracting TB while working.\n"}, {"Name": "Type 1 Diabetes", "Information": "\nDiabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.\nThe hormone insulin \u2013 produced by the pancreas \u2013 is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.\nThere are two main types of diabetes:\n\nType 1 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce any insulin\nType 2 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body\u2019s cells don't react to insulin\n\nThis topic is about type 1 diabetes.\nRead more about type 2 diabetes\nAnother type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth.\nIt's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.\nYou should therefore visit your GP if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and losing weight unexpectedly (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).\nType 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1.\nIn type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) progressively reduces the amount of insulin (the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels) it produces until it stops producing any at all.\nIf the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body's organs.\nDiabetes symptoms\nThe symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose is high but isn\u2019t used by your muscles as fuel for energy.\nWhen blood glucose is high, glucose is lost in your urine and you may become dehydrated.\nTypical symptoms include:\n\nfeeling very thirsty\npassing urine more often than usual, particularly at night\nfeeling very tired all the time\nweight loss and loss of muscle bulk\npersistent infections such as thrush\n\nThe symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few hours or days).

This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severely dehydrated.\nThis results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. This is called Type 1 diabetes.\nRead more about the causes of type 1 diabetes\nTreating type 1 diabetes\nIt's important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible.\u00a0If left untreated, type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. It's essential that treatment is started early.\nDiabetes can't be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life.\nIf you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.\nAs your body can't produce insulin, you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.\nInsulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. You'll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.\nInsulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid)\u00a0acting insulin (pump therapy). This is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that's inserted under the skin with a needle.\nThere are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they're only suitable for a small number of patients. They are:\n\nislet cell transplantation \u2013 where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes\na complete pancreas transplant \u2013 this is still relatively rare and only a few centres of excellence offer this.\n\nRead more about diagnosing diabetes and treating type 1 diabetes\nComplications\nIf diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems.

This means the immune system \u2013 the body's defence against infection \u2013 goes wrong and attacks healthy tissue.\nThe most popular theory is that the immune system mistakes harmless bacteria inside the colon for a threat and attacks the tissues of the colon, causing it to become inflamed.\nExactly what causes the immune system to behave in this way is unclear. Most experts think it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\nRead more about the causes of ulcerative colitis.\nWho's affected?\nIt's estimated that around 1 in every 420 people living in the UK has ulcerative colitis; this amounts to around 146,000 people.\nThe condition can\u00a0develop at any age, but is most often diagnosed in people from 15\u00a0to 25 years old.\nIt's more common in white people of European descent (especially those descended from Ashkenazi Jewish communities) and black people. The condition is\u00a0rarer in people\u00a0from Asian backgrounds (although the reasons for this are unclear).\nBoth men and women seem to be equally affected by ulcerative colitis.\nHow ulcerative colitis is treated\nTreatment for ulcerative colitis aims to relieve symptoms during a flare-up and prevent symptoms from returning (known as maintaining remission).\nIn most people, this is achieved by taking medication such as:\n\naminosalicylates (ASAs)\ncorticosteroids\nimmunosuppressants\n\nMild to moderate flare-ups can usually be treated at home. However, more\u00a0severe flare-ups\u00a0need to be\u00a0treated in hospital to reduce the risk of\u00a0serious complications, such as the colon becoming stretched and enlarged or developing large ulcers. Both of these can increase the risk of developing a hole in the bowel.\nIf medications aren't effective at controlling your symptoms, or your quality of life is significantly affected by\u00a0your condition, surgery to remove your colon may be an option.\nDuring surgery, your small intestine will either be diverted out of an opening in your abdomen (known as an ileostomy), or used to create an internal pouch that's connected to your anus (known as an ileo-anal pouch).\nRead more about:\n\ntreating ulcerative colitis\ncomplications of ulcerative colitis\n\n"}, {"Name": "Underactive Thyroid", "Information": "\nAn underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones.\nCommon signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.\nAn underactive thyroid can often be successfully\u00a0treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones\u00a0your thyroid isn't making.\nThere's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid.

type of kidney cancer in children. About 70 children in the UK develop a Wilms\u2019 tumour each year. It most often affects children under the age of five.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it\u2019s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\nWilms\u2019 tumour\nWilms\u2019 tumour is a type of kidney cancer that was named after Dr Max Wilms, who first described it. It is thought to come from very specialised cells in the embryo known as metanephric blastema. These cells are involved in the development of the child\u2019s kidneys while they are in the womb. The cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with Wilms\u2019 tumour, clusters of primitive kidneys cells, called nephrogenic rests can still be found.\nThe kidneys\nThe kidneys are a pair of organs found at the back of the abdomen. They clean the blood by removing excess fluids and waste products, which are then converted into urine.\nCauses\nIn most children, the causes of Wilms\u2019 tumour are unknown. Very rarely, people who develop Wilms\u2019 tumour have other specific conditions which are present at birth (congenital malformations). These include the lack of an iris in the eye (aniridia), abnormalities of the genitals, and a condition where one side of the body is slightly larger than the other (hemihypertrophy).\nIn 1 in 100 people with Wilms\u2019 tumour, another family member will also have Wilms\u2019 tumour.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe most common symptom is a swollen abdomen, which is usually painless. Sometimes a parent or carer may feel a lump in the abdomen which can be quite large. Occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can irritate the kidney and may be painful. There may be blood in your child\u2019s urine, or their blood pressure may be raised. The child may also have a high temperature (fever), upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite.\nHow Wilms\u2019 tumour is diagnosed\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a Wilms\u2019 tumour.\nAn abdominal ultrasound scan is usually the first thing that is done. This will be followed by an MRI and/or CT scan of the abdomen and chest. These scans help doctors to identify exactly where the tumour is and whether it has spread beyond the kidney. This is known as staging. Urine and blood samples will also be taken to check your child\u2019s kidney function and general health. Most children will go on to have a biopsy, where a sample of tissue is taken from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nStaging\nThe stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and the stage of the cancer helps doctors decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nIn the case of a Wilms\u2019 tumour, the stage is finalised after surgery to remove the tumour. As most Wilms\u2019 tumour patients receive chemotherapy before surgery, you may not know the exact stage of your child\u2019s tumour straight away. An exception is that babies under six months old usually have surgery straight away.\nA commonly used staging system for Wilms\u2019 tumour is described below:\nStage 1\nThe tumour is only affecting the kidney and has not begun to spread. It can be completely removed with surgery.\nStage 2\nThe tumour has begun to spread beyond the kidney to nearby structures, but it\u2019s still possible to remove it completely with surgery.\nStage 3\nThe tumour has spread beyond the kidney; either because the tumour has burst before (or during) the operation, has spread to lymph glands (nodes), or has not been completely removed by surgery.\nStage 4\nThe tumour has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or liver. Tumours in other parts of the body are known as metastases.\nStage 5\nThere are tumours in both kidneys (bilateral Wilms\u2019 tumour).\nIf the tumour comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent cancer or relapse.\nTreatment\nTreatment is planned by specialists in children\u2019s tumours and cancers. This is usually based in a children\u2019s oncology unit within a main hospital, but some treatment may be given closer to home.\nTreatment will depend on a number of factors including how the cells appear under the microscope (histology) and the stage of the tumour. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.\nSurgery\nAll children with Wilms\u2019 tumour will have surgery. Initially, this may only involve taking a small sample of cells from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. This is called a biopsy and is usually done under a general anaesthetic using a needle inserted through the skin.\nApart from very young children (under six months), most patients will receive chemotherapy before having a bigger operation to remove the entire tumour. The operation usually involves removing the whole of the affected kidney (nephrectomy).\nAfter examining the whole tumour under the microscope, Wilms\u2019 tumours can be divided into a number of risk groups based on knowledge about how these different types of tumours are likely to behave. The treatment following surgery will depend on these risk groups. The risk groups are known as LOW, STANDARD (or INTERMEDIATE), and HIGH.\nThe majority of tumours are in the \u2018standard risk\u2019 group. So-called \u2018low risk\u2019 tumours require less treatment than standard risk tumours.\nTwo types of Wilms\u2019 tumour - anaplastic and blastemal - are considered to be \u2018higher risk\u2019 than other Wilms\u2019 tumours and require more intensive (stronger) chemotherapy:\nAnaplastic Wilms\u2019 tumour\nAbout 5-10% of Wilms\u2019 tumours have an appearance called anaplasia, which means the cells look very disorganised under a microscope.\nBlastemal Wilms\u2019 tumour\nThis group of high-risk tumours cannot be identified by looking at the biopsy because they occur when a particular type of early kidney cell survives the pre-surgery chemotherapy. These cells are known as blastemal cells. Tumours, where most of these cells survive chemotherapy, are called blastemal tumours.\nOther kidney tumours\nOther, less common types of kidney tumours may occur in children. These are usually only recognised after surgery to obtain a tumour sample. \u2018Clear cell sarcoma\u2019 and \u2018malignant rhabdoid tumour\u2019 of the kidney are two types of cancerous tumour, with their own treatment recommendations.\nCongenital mesoblastic nephroma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumour that occurs in very young children; this type of tumour usually only needs surgery and no other treatment.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It\u2019s usually given as an injection or drip into a vein (intravenously). Chemotherapy given before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nWhat doctors find out about the tumour after surgery - for example, how the cells look under the microscope and how far the cancer has spread - helps them to decide whether additional chemotherapy should be given (adjuvant chemotherapy). This is to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). This chemotherapy may be given as inpatient or outpatient depending on tumour staging and risk group (see above).\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.\nNot all children with Wilms\u2019 tumour need radiotherapy. For those that do, the area to be treated depends on the stage of the tumour at diagnosis. Some children receive radiotherapy to the area around the affected kidney or, less commonly, to the whole abdomen. If the tumour has spread to the lungs, then lung radiotherapy may be needed but this depends on how well the cancer responds to initial chemotherapy; it\u2019s not always needed.\nRadiotherapy may occasionally be used to shrink tumours that are too large to remove surgically. This will, ideally, allow an operation to be done. Radiotherapy can also be used when tumours have spread elsewhere in the body.\nTreatment for bilateral Wilms\u2019 tumour\nIn about 1 in 20 cases, Wilms\u2019 tumour affects both kidneys. Treatment usually involves surgery to both. The aim of the treatment is to remove as much of the cancer as possible, while leaving as much healthy kidney as possible. Chemotherapy is always given. Sometimes radiotherapy is needed as well.\nSide effects of treatment\nTreatment for Wilms\u2019 tumour often causes side effects. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Many side effects are expected and managed effectively. Side effects can include feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting), hair loss, bruising and bleeding, tiredness, diarrhoea, and an increased risk of infection. Less common effects may include impact on the heart, kidneys, and liver.\nLate side effects\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart and lungs work, and a slight increase in their risk of developing another cancer in later life. Infertility is a possible late side effect, although this is rare.\nYour child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. These will depend on the exact treatments given.\nClinical trials\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness. The trial may include comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. It may just involve collecting patient and tumour details including response to treatment to increase specialists\u2019 knowledge. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you will be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child.\nTreatment guidelines\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group\u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up care\nMost children with Wilms\u2019 tumour are cured. If the cancer comes back, it\u2019s usually within the first two years. When one kidney is removed, the other will be able to work normally and can take over the work of the other kidney.\nVery few children have long-term kidney problems. Your child will have regular check-ups to look for any recurrence or problems following treatment.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nYour feelings\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.\n"}, {"Name": "Womb Uterus Cancer", "Information": "\nCancer of the womb (uterus) is a common cancer that affects the female reproductive system. It's also called uterine cancer and endometrial cancer.\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of womb cancer.\nIf you have been through the menopause, any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal. If you have not yet been through the menopause, unusual bleeding may include bleeding between your periods.\nYou should see your GP as soon as possible if you experience any unusual vaginal bleeding. While it's unlikely\u00a0to be\u00a0caused by womb cancer, it's best to be sure.\nYour GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. They will refer you to a specialist for further tests if they suspect you may have a serious problem, or if they are unsure about a diagnosis.\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of womb cancer and diagnosing womb cancer\nTypes of womb cancer\nThe vast majority of womb cancers\u00a0begin in the cells that make up the lining of the\u00a0womb (called the endometrium), which is why cancer of the womb\u00a0is often called endometrial cancer.\nIn rare cases, womb cancer can start in the muscles surrounding the womb. This type of cancer is called uterine sarcoma and may be treated in a different way from endometrial cancer.\nThis article uses the term womb cancer, and\u00a0mostly includes information about endometrial cancer. Read more information about soft tissue sarcomas.\nWomb cancer is separate\u00a0from other cancers of the female reproductive system, such as\u00a0ovarian cancer and cervical cancer.\nWhy does womb cancer happen?\nIt's not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition.\nA hormone imbalance is one of the most important risks for womb cancer. Specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body.\nA number of\u00a0things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, and\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\u00a0There is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen.\nIt's not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of contraception.\nRead more about the causes of womb cancer\nHow is womb cancer treated?\nThe most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy).\nA hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but\u00a0you\u00a0will no longer be able to get pregnant.\u00a0Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.\nRadiotherapy or\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0are also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery.\nA type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children.\nEven if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life.\nRead more about treating womb cancer\nLiving with womb cancer\nLiving with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways.\nFor example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. You may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive.\nYou may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer.\nRead more about living with womb cancer\nWho is affected?\nWomb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. It's the fourth most common cancer diagnosed\u00a0in women after breast cancer, lung cancer, and cancer of the colon and rectum.\nIn the UK, about 8,475 new cases of womb cancer are diagnosed each year. Womb cancer is more common in women who have been through the menopause, and most cases are diagnosed in women aged 40 to 74.\nWomb cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers diagnosed in women.\n"}, {"Name": "Yellow Fever", "Information": "\nYellow fever is a serious viral infection that is spread by certain types of mosquito. It\u2019s mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and parts of the Caribbean.\nThe condition can be prevented with a vaccination and is a very rare cause of illness in travellers.\nBetween 1999 and 2018, there was twelve cases of yellow fever reported among European travellers. None of these travellers were vaccinated, 5 of these cases occurred in 2018.\nIf you're planning to visit places where yellow fever infection is found, you should seek travel health advice before you travel. A map and list of countries where yellow fever is found is available on the NHS Fit for Travel website.\nHow yellow fever is spread\nThe virus that causes yellow fever is passed to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. The mosquitoes that spread the infection are usually active and bite during daylight hours, and are found in both urban and rural areas.\nYellow fever can\u2019t be passed directly from person to person through close contact.\nYellow fever symptoms\nThe symptoms of yellow fever occur in two stages. The initial symptoms develop three to six days after infection, and can include:\n\na high temperature (fever)\na headache\nnausea or vomiting\nmuscle pain, including backache\nloss of appetite\n\nThis stage will usually pass after three to four days and most people will make a full recovery.\nHowever, around 15% of people go on to develop more serious problems, including jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), kidney failure and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach (causing blood in your vomit and stools).\nUp to half of those who experience these symptoms will die.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see a doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of yellow fever and are currently travelling in an area where the virus is found, or have recently returned from one of these areas.\nTo help determine whether you have yellow fever, the doctor will want to know exactly where you have been travelling and what symptoms you have. A blood test will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreating yellow fever\nThere is no specific treatment for yellow fever, but you will be monitored and the symptoms can be treated.\nYou will be admitted to hospital for assessment and supportive care.\nYellow fever vaccination\nThe yellow fever vaccine protects you from infection when you travel to a country where yellow fever virus occurs and prevents the disease from spreading between countries.\nAfter you have received the vaccine you are given a yellow fever vaccine certificate to prove that you have received the vaccine and are protected from infection. This certificate is designed to fit inside your passport and is valid for life.\nThe countries that require proof of vaccination are those where either the disease occurs, or where it could occur because they have the correct mosquito and monkey species that could harbour the infection.\nMore about the yellow fever vaccine\nFind your nearest yellow fever vaccination centre\nInformation about you\nIf you have yellow fever, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register.\n"}]
