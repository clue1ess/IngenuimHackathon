But sometimes the pain carries on for longer or comes on without any history of an injury or operation.\nChronic pain can also affect people living with:\n\ndiabetes\narthritis\nfibromyalgia\nirritable bowel\nback pain\n\nWhat is pain?\nThe brain and the nerves inside the spine (the spinal nerves) make up the central nervous system. The spinal nerves carry messages from the body to the brain\u00a0to tell it what's going on.\nThe brain acts like a control centre working out from these messages if it needs to do anything.\u00a0 It's sometimes easier to think of how the messages and the brain combine together to form an alarm system. It's the brain\u2019s interpretation of this information from the alarm system that results in the feeling of pain. Sometimes the brain\u2019s interpretation of these signals isn't accurate.\nWe usually expect pain to settle down with time but sometimes the brain continues to send out pain signals. These signals can be hard to stop, are often intense and at times seem to come for no obvious reason. This fact isn't always easy to understand but it important to understand that this pain is still \u201creal\u201d.\nPain is very real and can be complex.\u00a0\nMore about the causes of pain\nHow common is chronic pain?\nChronic pain affects 1 in 5 people in Scotland. It can affect all ages and all parts of the body.\nIt isn't possible to tell in advance whose pain will become chronic. But we know that people are more likely to develop chronic pain during or after times of stress or unhappiness.\nPeople can also experience chronic pain even after usual medical tests don\u2019t provide an answer.\nWhat can I do for myself?\nThere\u2019s a lot you can do to help yourself and have a better life even with chronic pain. Simple changes can often make a big difference to the amount of disability and suffering you can experience. This is called pain management.\nTo help manage your pain, you might consider:\n\nPlanning your day - Make a plan of things to do and places to be to help you keep on top of your pain.\nPacing yourself - Don\u2019t push through the pain, stop before it gets worse then go back to whatever you were doing later.\nLearning to relax - Relaxing can be hard when you have pain but finding something which relaxes you will reduce the stress of pain.\nTaking regular enjoyable exercise - Even a small amount will make you feel better and ease your pain. It will also keep your muscles and joints strong.\nTaking pain medicine\u00a0- Pain medicines work better alongside a plan. Patients often say their pain medicines don\u2019t seem to work very well.\nTalking to others - Tell your friends and family about chronic pain and why you need to do things differently at the moment.\nEnjoyment - Doing things you enjoy boosts your own natural painkillers. Think about what you enjoyed before the pain and introduce it back into your routin\n\nActivity and exercise\nBeing active and taking exercise is a good prescription for managing pain. Knowing where to start can be daunting for some people with chronic pain as they often find it hard to do things on some days more than others. Don\u2019t be put off by the word \u2018exercise\u2019 - any type of movement is exercise.\nTo begin with your muscles might hurt so it's important that you choose a level of exercise that suits you. Learning how to \u2018pace\u2019 your activity and exercise can help. Most of all it should be enjoyable.\nWalking\nThis might start off with walk up and down your path or a walk to the end of the street and back. A local park is also a good option, especially if it has benches for you to rest on along the way.\nIf you feel able to walk further, joining a local walking group is a good way to keep active and motivated. Some of these groups are run by local councils and offer different levels of difficulty for beginners and upwards. You can also find walking groups through Ramblers Scotland.\nDancing or moving to music\nDancing or moving to music, either sitting down or standing up (or a mixture of both), is a great way to exercise.\nExercising in the pool\nYou don\u2019t need to know how to swim to be able to exercise in a swimming pool. The buoyancy of the water makes us feel lighter. This can make movement and exercise easier than on dry land.\nSpend 10 to 15 minutes in the water to begin with. Slow movements are best. If you don\u2019t swim take someone with you and stay close to the side.\nExercise classes\nIf you'd prefer to exercise with others, you can find out about exercises classes from your local sports centre. Classes range in difficulty so remember to ask what level of exercise each class offers.\nExercise referral schemes\nMany health care professionals can refer patients to exercise programmes that have been designed to help people become more active.\nThese programmes are often based at local sport centres with specialists available to give advice and help to design an exercise programme that meets your needs.\nAsk your GP or any health care professional about programmes available in your area.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)\nA TENS machine is a simple way of blocking pain signals using self-adhesive pads to pass an electric current through the skin. It\u2019s a bit like rubbing the sore bit better or using a hot water bottle to provide comfort.\nYou can buy TENS machines from pharmacists, supermarkets or online. Prices start from \u00a38.99 for a simple machine. You shouldn\u2019t need to spend more than \u00a330 to get a machine with 2 sets of pads and a fully adjustable pulse rate and width.\nMore about\u00a0TENS for pain relief\u00a0from Pain Concern\nDealing with stress and depression\nWhen the body feels under threat it produces stress hormones that make us feel anxious and tense. The body sees pain as a threat and when it's persistent or chronic, it can make us feel unwell.\nRelaxation\nFinding a way to relax can help to reduce pain. Anything which makes you feel good, you enjoy or gives you pleasure is a form of relaxation.\nHobbies and activities may have taken a backseat due to your pain, but it's worth thinking about how to get back to doing things you enjoy. Anything that helps you to focus on things other than your pain is a good form of self-management.\nLearn some relaxation techniques\nDepression\nEffective pain management tackles all aspects of your life affected by chronic pain - including your mental wellbeing.\nMore about low mood and depression\nPain medication\nPain medication can help to reduce your pain and keep you moving. In some cases they won't be effective at treating your pain and can cause side effects.\nIf you're already taking medication or have other health problems, it's important to check with your pharmacist before taking any non-prescription pain medication.\nPharmacists are a great source of information about chronic pain and medication.\nWhen should I see my doctor?\nIf you're still in pain after 12 weeks, speak to your GP if you haven't already done so. Your GP will be able to tell you the best plan for managing your pain.\n"}, {"Name": "Living Well With Coeliac Disease", "Cure": "\nLiving with coeliac disease can be challenging but with the right support and information, it's completely manageable.\n\nThere are some things you can do which will help you cope better with your condition and diet.

The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in\u00a0hot weather)\u00a0and your diet can contribute to dehydration.\nYou can also\u00a0become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as\u00a0persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or\u00a0sweating from a fever.\nRead more about the causes of dehydration\nWho is at risk from dehydration?\nAnyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk.

These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts.\nIf you're finding it difficult to keep water down because you're vomiting,\u00a0try drinking small amounts more frequently.\nInfants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is\u00a0because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems.\nInstead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies).

Dizziness\u00a0that happens when you're lying down is usually caused by a viral ear infection, which can't be treated with antibiotics.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep a diary of your dizziness, recording when and where you experience the problem, and take it with you to your GP appointment. It's helpful to note:\n\nwhat you were doing at the time of your dizziness\nhow long it lasted and how bad it was\nwhether you had any other symptoms\u00a0\u2013 such as fainting,\u00a0vomiting, nausea, blurred vision, headache,\u00a0hearing loss or\u00a0tinnitus\n\nIf you're taking prescription medicine, your GP will probably review this to check whether dizziness is a possible side effect.

You should also see a dentist regularly, so they can identify and treat any problems early on.\nTreating a dry mouth\nTreating the underlying cause\nIf your doctor or dentist is able to determine what's causing your dry mouth, treating this may improve your symptoms.\nFor example, if medication is suspected as the cause of your dry mouth, your doctor may reduce your dose or suggest trying an alternative medication.\nSome of the conditions mentioned above\u00a0have specific treatments, such as nasal\u00a0decongestants for a blocked nose and insulin for diabetes.\nThings to try yourself\nThere are simple measures you can\u00a0try to help keep your mouth moist. For example, it may help to:\n\nincrease your fluid intake \u2013 take regular sips of cold water or an unsweetened drink\nsuck on sugar-free sweets or chew sugar-free gum \u2013 this can stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva\nsuck on ice cubes \u2013 the ice will melt slowly and moisten your mouth\navoid alcohol (including alcohol-based mouthwashes), caffeine and smoking \u2013 these can all make a dry mouth worse\n\nSaliva substitutes and stimulants\nIf the measures above don\u2019t help, your dentist, GP\u00a0or specialist may suggest using an artificial saliva substitute to keep your mouth moist. This may come in the form of a spray, gel or lozenge. Use it as often as you need to, including before and during meals.\nIf your dry mouth is caused by radiotherapy or\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome,\u00a0a medication called pilocarpine may be prescribed.

However, it can usually be controlled with\u00a0changes to your diet and lifestyle.\nFlatulence is\u00a0a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about\u00a05 to 15 times a day.\nWhy\u00a0it happens\nWhen you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by\u00a0farting (flatulence) or\u00a0burping (belching).\nSometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur.

Although meningitis has become less common over recent years, it's important to be aware of the rash and the other signs and symptoms of meningitis.\nCellulitis\nCellulitis\u00a0is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and underlying tissue. The affected area will be red, painful, swollen and hot. It often affects the legs, but can occur anywhere on the body. Your child will probably also have a fever.\nSee your GP immediately if an area of your child's skin suddenly turns red, hot and tender. If you can't see your GP on the same day, go to a walk-in centre or minor injuries unit.\nCellulitis can usually be diagnosed by assessing the symptoms and examining the skin. It usually responds well to treatment with antibiotics.\nChickenpox\nChickenpox\u00a0is a viral illness that most children catch at some point. It most commonly affects children under 10 years of age.\nA rash of itchy spots turns into fluid-filled blisters.\u00a0They crust over to form scabs, which after a while drop off. Some children only have a few spots, whereas others have them over their entire body.\u00a0The spots are most likely to appear on the face, ears and scalp, under the arms, on the chest and belly, and on the arms and legs.\nThere's no specific treatment for chickenpox, but you can take\u00a0steps to relieve the symptoms. For example,\u00a0paracetamol can\u00a0help relieve fever (don't give aspirin to children under 16), and calamine lotion and cooling gels can be used to ease itching.\nRead more about treating chickenpox.\nEczema\nEczema\u00a0is a long-term condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. The most common type is atopic eczema, which mainly affects children but can continue into adulthood.\nAtopic eczema commonly develops behind the knees or on the elbows, neck, eyes and ears. It\u00a0isn't a serious condition, but if your child later becomes infected with the\u00a0herpes simplex virus, it can\u00a0cause the eczema to flare up into an outbreak of tiny blisters called eczema herpeticum, and will cause a fever.\nAbout one in five children in the UK\u00a0has eczema, and in eight out 10 cases it develops before the age of five, often before a child's first birthday.\u00a0\nRead about\u00a0treating atopic eczema.\nErythema multiforme\nErythema multiforme\u00a0is a skin rash\u00a0(usually mild) that's caused by an allergic reaction to the\u00a0herpes simplex virus.\nThe spots look like targets, with a dark red centre and paler ring around the outside. The hands or feet tend to be affected first, followed by the limbs, upper body and face.\nYour child will probably feel unwell and may have a fever, which you should be able to treat with over-the-counter medicine. It may take\u00a0from two\u00a0to six weeks before they feel better.\u00a0See your GP if your child has a rash and seems unwell.\nIn rare cases, erythema multiforme can be triggered by a reaction to certain medications, such as an antibiotic or anticonvulsant. This more severe form is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome and it can be\u00a0life-threatening.\nHand, foot and mouth disease\nHand, foot and mouth disease\u00a0is a common, contagious infection that causes mouth ulcers\u00a0and spots and blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\nIt's most common in young children (particularly those under 10), but it can also affect older children and adults.\nThere's no cure for hand, foot and mouth disease\u00a0and\u00a0it's easily spread, so you should keep your child away from school or nursery until they're better. Your child's immune system will fight the virus and it should clear up after about seven to 10 days.\nMake sure your child drinks plenty of fluid, and\u00a0if eating and swallowing is uncomfortable, give them soft foods, such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and soup.\nImpetigo\nImpetigo\u00a0is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It isn't usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment. There are two types of impetigo\u00a0\u2013 bullous and non-bullous.\nBullous impetigo typically affects the trunk (the area of the body between the waist and neck), and causes fluid-filled blisters that burst after a few days to leave a yellow crust.\nNon-bullous impetigo typically affects the skin around the nose and mouth, causing sores that quickly burst to leave a yellow-brown crust.\nSee your GP if you think your child has impetigo. Antibiotics, in the form of a cream or tablets, will be prescribed. This should reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days.\nKeratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\")\nKeratosis pilaris\u00a0is a common and harmless skin condition. The skin on the back of the upper arms becomes rough and bumpy, as if covered in permanent goose pimples. Sometimes, the buttocks, thighs, forearms and upper back can also be affected.\nKeratosis pilaris typically begins in childhood and gets worse during puberty. Some people find it improves after this and may even disappear in adulthood.\nThere's no cure for keratosis pilaris,\u00a0and it often gets better on its own without treatment. However, there are some measures you can take that may improve your child's rash, such as using non-soap cleansers rather than soap, and\u00a0an emollient to moisturise their skin. Your GP or pharmacist will be able to recommend a suitable cream.\nMeasles\nMeasles\u00a0is a highly infectious illness that most commonly affects young children. It's now rare in the UK because of the effectiveness of\u00a0the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\nThe measles rash is red-brown blotches. It usually starts on the head or upper neck and then spreads outwards to the rest of the body. Your child may also have a fever and\u00a0cold-like symptoms.\nCall your GP surgery immediately if you think your child has measles. It's best to phone before visiting because the surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.\nMeasles usually passes in about seven to 10 days without causing further problems.\u00a0Paracetamol or\u00a0ibuprofen can be used to relieve fever, aches and pains (don't give aspirin to children under 16). Also, make sure your child drinks plenty of water to avoid dehydration.\nRead more about\u00a0treating measles.\nMolluscum contagiosum\nMolluscum contagiosum\u00a0is a viral skin infection that causes clusters of\u00a0small, firm, raised spots to develop on the skin.\nIt commonly affects young children aged one to five years, who tend to catch it after close physical contact with another infected child.\nThe condition is usually painless, although some children may experience some itchiness. It usually goes away within 18 months without the need for treatment.\nMolluscum contagiosum is highly infectious. However, most adults are resistant to the virus, which means they're unlikely to\u00a0catch it if they come into contact with it.\nPityriasis rosea\nPityriasis rosea\u00a0is a relatively common skin condition that causes\u00a0a temporary rash of raised, red scaly patches to develop on the body.\u00a0Most cases occur in older children and young adults (aged between 10 and 35).\nThe rash can be very itchy. In most cases,\u00a0it clears up without treatment in\u00a02 to 12 weeks, although in\u00a0rare cases it can last up to five months.\nEmollients,\u00a0steroid creams\u00a0and antihistamines can be used to help relieve the itchiness. The rash doesn't usually leave scars, although the skin can sometimes be discoloured afterwards.\nPrickly heat (heat rash)\nPrickly heat (heat rash), also known as miliaria,\u00a0is an itchy rash of small, raised red spots that causes a stinging or prickly sensation on the skin.\nIt occurs when the sweat ducts in the outer layer of skin (epidermis)\u00a0are obstructed. You can get a heat rash anywhere on your body, but the face, neck, back, chest or thighs are most often affected.\nInfants can sometimes get a prickly heat rash if they sweat more than usual\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, when it's hot and humid or if they're overdressed. It isn't a serious condition and rarely requires any specific treatment.\nPsoriasis\nPsoriasis\u00a0is a long-lasting (chronic) skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.\nThe severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person.\u00a0For some people, it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have\u00a0a major impact on their quality of life.\u00a0\nThere's no cure for psoriasis, but there are a number of treatments that can help improve the symptoms and appearance of skin patches. For example, topical corticosteroids are creams and ointments that can be applied to the skin.\nRingworm\nRingworm\u00a0is a highly infectious fungal skin infection that causes a ring-like red or silvery patch on the skin that can be scaly, inflamed or itchy.\nRingworm often affects the arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on\u00a0the body. Other similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails.\nRingworm can usually be easily treated with antifungal medicines, which\u00a0are\u00a0available from a pharmacy.\u00a0Ringworm of the scalp can cause scaling and patches of hair loss. It's treated with antifungal tablets, often combined with antifungal shampoo.\nScabies\nScabies\u00a0is a contagious skin condition that's intensely itchy. It's caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin.\nIn children, scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected adult or child \u2013 for example, during play fighting or hugging.\nThe mites like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock creases. They leave small red blotches, which are often found on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. In infants, blisters are commonly found on the soles of the feet.\u00a0\nSee your GP if you think your child has scabies. It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. Your GP will prescribe a lotion or cream. Read more about treating scabies.\nScarlet fever\nScarlet fever\u00a0is a highly contagious bacterial infection that usually affects children between two and eight years of age. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash, which feels like sandpaper to touch and may be itchy.\nIt often starts with a sore throat, fever and headache, with the rash developing two to five days after infection. The rash usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck.\nScarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but see your GP if you think your child may have it.\u00a0Antibiotics are used to treat it (liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin, are often used to treat children).\nSlapped cheek syndrome\nSlapped cheek syndrome\u00a0\u2013 also known as fifth disease or parvovirus B19\u00a0\u2013 is a viral infection that's common in children aged six to 10.\nIt causes a distinctive bright red rash to develop on both cheeks. This can look alarming, but it usually clears up by itself in one to three weeks.\nUnless your child is feeling unwell, they don't need to stay away from school. Once the rash appears, the infection is no longer contagious. However, it's a good idea to notify your child's school about the infection.\nUrticaria (hives)\nUrticaria\u00a0\u2013 also known as hives, weals, welts or nettle rash \u2013 is a raised, itchy rash that can affect one part of the body or be spread across large areas.\u00a0It's\u00a0a common skin reaction that often affects children.\nUrticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin. These substances cause the blood vessels in the skin to open up, resulting in\u00a0redness or pinkness, and swelling and itchiness.\nThere are many possible triggers of urticaria, including allergens, such as food or latex, irritants, such as nettles, medicines, and physical factors, such as heat or exercise. Sometimes, a cause can't be identified.\nThe rash is usually short-lived and mild, and can often be controlled with antihistamines.\n"}, {"Name": "Shortness Of Breath", "Cure": "\nSudden shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty (dyspnoea), is the most common reason for visiting a hospital accident and emergency department.\nIt's also one of the most common reasons people call 999 for an ambulance.\nIt's normal to get out of breath when you've overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it's usually a warning sign of a medical condition.\nThe information below outlines the most common reasons for:\n\nsudden shortness of breath\nlong-term shortness of breath\n\nThis guide shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what's causing your breathlessness.\nWhen to call a doctor\nYou should call your GP immediately if you have sudden unexpected shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart.\nYour GP will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is mild or the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit.\nIf you've struggled with your breathing for a while, don't ignore it. See your GP as it's likely you have a long-term condition, such as obesity, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which needs to be managed properly.\nYour doctor may ask you some questions, such as:\n\nDid the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually?\nDid anything trigger it, such as exercise?\nHow bad is it? Does it only happen when you've been active, or when you're not doing anything?\nIs there any pain when you breathe?\nDo you have a cough?\nDo certain positions make it worse \u2013 for example, are you unable to lie down?\n\nFeeling like you can't get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed.\nCauses of sudden shortness of breath\nSudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the references at the end for more information about these conditions.\nA problem with your lungs or airways\nSudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways.\nYour GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness.\nPneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection, so you'll need to take antibiotics.\nIf you have COPD, it's likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse.\nA heart problem\nIt's possible to have a \"silent\" heart attack without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety.\nIn this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they'll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away.\nHeart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of fluid inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult.\nA combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness.\nBreathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate).\nPanic attack or anxiety\nA panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag can bring your breathing back to normal but should only be done when you are certain anxiety is the cause of your breathlessness.\nMore unusual causes\nThese include:\n\na severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)\npneumothorax \u2013 partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs\npulmonary embolism \u2013 a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \u2013 a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs\npleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung\ndiabetic ketoacidosis \u2013 a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine\n\nCauses of long-term breathlessness\nLong-term breathlessness is usually caused by:\n\nobesity or being unfit\npoorly controlled asthma\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2013 permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking\nanaemia \u2013 a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen)\nheart failure \u2013 when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly\na problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate)\n\nMore unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are:\n\nbronchiectasis \u2013 a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough\npulmonary embolism \u2013 a recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung\npartial collapse of your lung caused by lung cancer\npleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung\nnarrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body\nfrequent panic attacks, which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths)\n\n"}, {"Name": "Shoulder Problems", "Cure": "\nShoulder problems can cause a range of symptoms including pain, stiffness and weakness.\nIn many cases, new or flare-up of long-standing shoulder problems should begin to settle within 6 weeks without the need to see a healthcare professional.\nWhen to seek help\nSpeak to a healthcare professional as soon as possible if there's been significant trauma, for example a fall from height or direct blow to the shoulder, and your pain is preventing any shoulder movement at all.\nWhat causes shoulder problems?\nShoulder problems are common and are often caused by simple things like:\n\ntaking off your coat\nlifting something awkwardly\ntaking part in sport\na trip or fall\n\nAs you get older, normal age-related changes can cause your shoulder problem to flare-up now and again, often for no reason.\nCan this cause problems anywhere else?\nYou may feel pains around your shoulder and neck, and into your arm.\nSelf-help\nKeeping active is an essential part of your treatment and recovery and is the single best thing you can do for your health.\nBeing physically active can:\n\nmaintain your current levels of fitness \u2013 even if you have to modify what you normally do, any activity is better than none\nkeep your other muscles and joints strong and flexible\nprevent a recurrence of the problem\nhelp you aim for a healthy body weight\n\nAvoid sports or heavy lifting until you have less discomfort and good movement.

Most rashes are harmless and disappear without the need for treatment.\nHowever,\u00a0see your GP if your child has a rash and seems unwell, or if you're worried. They'll be able to investigate the cause and recommend any necessary treatment.\nThis page may give you a better idea about what could be causing the rash, but\u00a0don't use this to self-diagnose your child's condition \u2013 always see a GP for a proper diagnosis.\nThe most common causes of rashes in children are:\n\ncellulitis\nchickenpox\u00a0\neczema\nerythema multiforme\u00a0\nhand, foot and mouth disease\u00a0\u00a0\nimpetigo\nkeratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\")\nmeasles\nmolluscum contagiosum\npityriasis rosea\nprickly heat\npsoriasis\nringworm\u00a0\nscabies\nscarlet fever\u00a0\nslapped cheek syndrome\nurticaria (hives)\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0skin rash of meningitis is also covered on the page. Although meningitis has become less common over recent years, it's important to be aware of the rash and the other signs and symptoms of meningitis.\nCellulitis\nCellulitis\u00a0is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and underlying tissue. The affected area will be red, painful, swollen and hot. It often affects the legs, but can occur anywhere on the body. Your child will probably also have a fever.\nSee your GP immediately if an area of your child's skin suddenly turns red, hot and tender. If you can't see your GP on the same day, go to a walk-in centre or minor injuries unit.\nCellulitis can usually be diagnosed by assessing the symptoms and examining the skin. It usually responds well to treatment with antibiotics.\nChickenpox\nChickenpox\u00a0is a viral illness that most children catch at some point. It most commonly affects children under 10 years of age.\nA rash of itchy spots turns into fluid-filled blisters.\u00a0They crust over to form scabs, which after a while drop off. Some children only have a few spots, whereas others have them over their entire body.\u00a0The spots are most likely to appear on the face, ears and scalp, under the arms, on the chest and belly, and on the arms and legs.\nThere's no specific treatment for chickenpox, but you can take\u00a0steps to relieve the symptoms. For example,\u00a0paracetamol can\u00a0help relieve fever (don't give aspirin to children under 16), and calamine lotion and cooling gels can be used to ease itching.\nRead more about treating chickenpox.\nEczema\nEczema\u00a0is a long-term condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. The most common type is atopic eczema, which mainly affects children but can continue into adulthood.\nAtopic eczema commonly develops behind the knees or on the elbows, neck, eyes and ears. It\u00a0isn't a serious condition, but if your child later becomes infected with the\u00a0herpes simplex virus, it can\u00a0cause the eczema to flare up into an outbreak of tiny blisters called eczema herpeticum, and will cause a fever.\nAbout one in five children in the UK\u00a0has eczema, and in eight out 10 cases it develops before the age of five, often before a child's first birthday.\u00a0\nRead about\u00a0treating atopic eczema.\nErythema multiforme\nErythema multiforme\u00a0is a skin rash\u00a0(usually mild) that's caused by an allergic reaction to the\u00a0herpes simplex virus.\nThe spots look like targets, with a dark red centre and paler ring around the outside. The hands or feet tend to be affected first, followed by the limbs, upper body and face.\nYour child will probably feel unwell and may have a fever, which you should be able to treat with over-the-counter medicine. It may take\u00a0from two\u00a0to six weeks before they feel better.\u00a0See your GP if your child has a rash and seems unwell.\nIn rare cases, erythema multiforme can be triggered by a reaction to certain medications, such as an antibiotic or anticonvulsant. This more severe form is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome and it can be\u00a0life-threatening.\nHand, foot and mouth disease\nHand, foot and mouth disease\u00a0is a common, contagious infection that causes mouth ulcers\u00a0and spots and blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\nIt's most common in young children (particularly those under 10), but it can also affect older children and adults.\nThere's no cure for hand, foot and mouth disease\u00a0and\u00a0it's easily spread, so you should keep your child away from school or nursery until they're better. Your child's immune system will fight the virus and it should clear up after about seven to 10 days.\nMake sure your child drinks plenty of fluid, and\u00a0if eating and swallowing is uncomfortable, give them soft foods, such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and soup.\nImpetigo\nImpetigo\u00a0is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It isn't usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment. There are two types of impetigo\u00a0\u2013 bullous and non-bullous.\nBullous impetigo typically affects the trunk (the area of the body between the waist and neck), and causes fluid-filled blisters that burst after a few days to leave a yellow crust.\nNon-bullous impetigo typically affects the skin around the nose and mouth, causing sores that quickly burst to leave a yellow-brown crust.\nSee your GP if you think your child has impetigo. Antibiotics, in the form of a cream or tablets, will be prescribed. This should reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days.\nKeratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\")\nKeratosis pilaris\u00a0is a common and harmless skin condition. The skin on the back of the upper arms becomes rough and bumpy, as if covered in permanent goose pimples. Sometimes, the buttocks, thighs, forearms and upper back can also be affected.\nKeratosis pilaris typically begins in childhood and gets worse during puberty. Some people find it improves after this and may even disappear in adulthood.\nThere's no cure for keratosis pilaris,\u00a0and it often gets better on its own without treatment. However, there are some measures you can take that may improve your child's rash, such as using non-soap cleansers rather than soap, and\u00a0an emollient to moisturise their skin. Your GP or pharmacist will be able to recommend a suitable cream.\nMeasles\nMeasles\u00a0is a highly infectious illness that most commonly affects young children. It's now rare in the UK because of the effectiveness of\u00a0the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\nThe measles rash is red-brown blotches. It usually starts on the head or upper neck and then spreads outwards to the rest of the body. Your child may also have a fever and\u00a0cold-like symptoms.\nCall your GP surgery immediately if you think your child has measles. It's best to phone before visiting because the surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.\nMeasles usually passes in about seven to 10 days without causing further problems.\u00a0Paracetamol or\u00a0ibuprofen can be used to relieve fever, aches and pains (don't give aspirin to children under 16). Also, make sure your child drinks plenty of water to avoid dehydration.\nRead more about\u00a0treating measles.\nMolluscum contagiosum\nMolluscum contagiosum\u00a0is a viral skin infection that causes clusters of\u00a0small, firm, raised spots to develop on the skin.\nIt commonly affects young children aged one to five years, who tend to catch it after close physical contact with another infected child.\nThe condition is usually painless, although some children may experience some itchiness. It usually goes away within 18 months without the need for treatment.\nMolluscum contagiosum is highly infectious. However, most adults are resistant to the virus, which means they're unlikely to\u00a0catch it if they come into contact with it.\nPityriasis rosea\nPityriasis rosea\u00a0is a relatively common skin condition that causes\u00a0a temporary rash of raised, red scaly patches to develop on the body.\u00a0Most cases occur in older children and young adults (aged between 10 and 35).\nThe rash can be very itchy. In most cases,\u00a0it clears up without treatment in\u00a02 to 12 weeks, although in\u00a0rare cases it can last up to five months.\nEmollients,\u00a0steroid creams\u00a0and antihistamines can be used to help relieve the itchiness. The rash doesn't usually leave scars, although the skin can sometimes be discoloured afterwards.\nPrickly heat (heat rash)\nPrickly heat (heat rash), also known as miliaria,\u00a0is an itchy rash of small, raised red spots that causes a stinging or prickly sensation on the skin.\nIt occurs when the sweat ducts in the outer layer of skin (epidermis)\u00a0are obstructed. You can get a heat rash anywhere on your body, but the face, neck, back, chest or thighs are most often affected.\nInfants can sometimes get a prickly heat rash if they sweat more than usual\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, when it's hot and humid or if they're overdressed. It isn't a serious condition and rarely requires any specific treatment.\nPsoriasis\nPsoriasis\u00a0is a long-lasting (chronic) skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.\nThe severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person.\u00a0For some people, it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have\u00a0a major impact on their quality of life.\u00a0\nThere's no cure for psoriasis, but there are a number of treatments that can help improve the symptoms and appearance of skin patches. For example, topical corticosteroids are creams and ointments that can be applied to the skin.\nRingworm\nRingworm\u00a0is a highly infectious fungal skin infection that causes a ring-like red or silvery patch on the skin that can be scaly, inflamed or itchy.\nRingworm often affects the arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on\u00a0the body. Other similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails.\nRingworm can usually be easily treated with antifungal medicines, which\u00a0are\u00a0available from a pharmacy.\u00a0Ringworm of the scalp can cause scaling and patches of hair loss. It's treated with antifungal tablets, often combined with antifungal shampoo.\nScabies\nScabies\u00a0is a contagious skin condition that's intensely itchy. It's caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin.\nIn children, scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected adult or child \u2013 for example, during play fighting or hugging.\nThe mites like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock creases. They leave small red blotches, which are often found on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. In infants, blisters are commonly found on the soles of the feet.\u00a0\nSee your GP if you think your child has scabies. It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. Your GP will prescribe a lotion or cream. Read more about treating scabies.\nScarlet fever\nScarlet fever\u00a0is a highly contagious bacterial infection that usually affects children between two and eight years of age. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash, which feels like sandpaper to touch and may be itchy.\nIt often starts with a sore throat, fever and headache, with the rash developing two to five days after infection. The rash usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck.\nScarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but see your GP if you think your child may have it.\u00a0Antibiotics are used to treat it (liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin, are often used to treat children).\nSlapped cheek syndrome\nSlapped cheek syndrome\u00a0\u2013 also known as fifth disease or parvovirus B19\u00a0\u2013 is a viral infection that's common in children aged six to 10.\nIt causes a distinctive bright red rash to develop on both cheeks. This can look alarming, but it usually clears up by itself in one to three weeks.\nUnless your child is feeling unwell, they don't need to stay away from school. Once the rash appears, the infection is no longer contagious. However, it's a good idea to notify your child's school about the infection.\nUrticaria (hives)\nUrticaria\u00a0\u2013 also known as hives, weals, welts or nettle rash \u2013 is a raised, itchy rash that can affect one part of the body or be spread across large areas.\u00a0It's\u00a0a common skin reaction that often affects children.\nUrticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin. These substances cause the blood vessels in the skin to open up, resulting in\u00a0redness or pinkness, and swelling and itchiness.\nThere are many possible triggers of urticaria, including allergens, such as food or latex, irritants, such as nettles, medicines, and physical factors, such as heat or exercise. Sometimes, a cause can't be identified.\nThe rash is usually short-lived and mild, and can often be controlled with antihistamines.\n"}, {"Name": "Sore Throat", "Cure": "\nSore throats are very common and usually nothing to worry about.

These help to fight bacteria, viruses and anything else that causes infection. They are an important part of the immune system and are found throughout\u00a0the body.\nThe glands\u00a0can swell to more than a few centimetres in response to infection or disease. Swollen glands, known medically as lymphadenopathy,\u00a0may be felt under the chin or in the neck, armpits or\u00a0groin, where they can be found in larger clumps.\nMany different types of infection can cause swollen glands, such as a cold\u00a0or glandular fever.

For some people it may come and go and only be a minor irritation.\nHowever, for some people, it can have a significant impact on everyday life and be very distressing, affect concentration, and cause problems such as difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression.\nIn many cases, tinnitus will get better gradually over time, either by disappearing or by the body getting used to it (habituation). But it's important to seek medical advice to see if an underlying cause can be found and treated, and to help you find ways to cope with the problem.\nWhen to see your GP\nYou should see your GP if you continually or regularly hear sounds such as buzzing, ringing or humming in your ears.\nThey can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition they could easily treat, such as an ear infection or earwax build-up. They can also do some simple checks to see if you have any hearing loss.\nIf necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests and treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing tinnitus.\nWhat causes tinnitus?\nTinnitus can develop gradually over time or occur suddenly. It's not clear exactly why it happens, but it often occurs along with some degree of hearing loss.\nTinnitus is often associated with:\n\nage-related hearing loss\ninner ear damage caused by repeated exposure to loud noises\nan earwax build-up\na middle ear infection\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \u2013 a condition that also causes hearing loss and vertigo (a spinning sensation)\notosclerosis \u2013 an inherited condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss\n\nHowever, around one in every three people with tinnitus doesn't have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing.\nRead more about the causes of tinnitus.\nWho is affected?\nMost people have experienced short periods of tinnitus after being exposed to loud noises, such as after a music concert.\nIn the UK, more persistent tinnitus is estimated to affect around six million people (10% of the population) to some degree, with about 600,000 (1%) experiencing it to a severity that affects their quality of life.\nTinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children, but is more common in people aged over 65.\nTreating tinnitus\nThere's currently no single treatment for tinnitus that works for everyone. However, research to find an effective treatment is continuing.\nIf an underlying cause of your tinnitus can be found, effectively treating it may help improve your tinnitus \u2013 for example, removing a build-up of earwax might help.\nIf a specific cause can't be found, treatment will focus on helping you manage the condition on a daily basis. This may involve:\n\nsound therapy \u2013 listening to neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus\ncounselling \u2013 therapy that aims to educate you about tinnitus and help you learn to cope with it more effectively\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 therapy that aims to help change the way you think about your tinnitus so it becomes less noticeable\ntinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) \u2013 therapy that aims to help retrain the way your brain responds to tinnitus so you start to tune the sound out and become less aware of it\n\nRead more about how tinnitus is treated.\n"}, {"Name": "Toothache", "Cure": "\nToothache refers to pain in and around the teeth and jaws that's usually caused by tooth decay.\nYou may feel toothache in many ways. It can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold.\nThe pain can also be mild or severe. It may feel \"sharp\" and start suddenly. It can be worse at night, particularly when you're lying down. A lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain.\nIt can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. When a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it's coming from the ear.\nToothache in other upper teeth may feel like it's coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead.\nThe area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch.\nIt's also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a \"dull\" pain. Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth.\nWhen to see your dentist\nIf you have toothache for more than one or two days, visit your dentist as soon as possible to have it treated. The longer you leave it, the worse it will get.\nIf your toothache isn't treated, the pulp inside your tooth will eventually become infected. This can usually lead to a dental abscess, with severe and continuous throbbing pain.\nPainkillers, such as\u00a0paracetamol and ibuprofen, may reduce the pain and discomfort while you're waiting for an appointment.\u00a0Children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin.\nFind a dentist near you.\nWhat causes toothache?\nToothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of\u00a0sensitive nerves and blood vessels.\nDental pulp can become inflamed as a result of:\n\ntooth decay\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this leads to holes (cavities) forming in the hard surface of the tooth\na cracked tooth \u2013\u00a0the crack\u00a0is often so small that it can't be seen with the naked eye\nloose or broken fillings\nreceding gums \u2013\u00a0where the gums shrink\u00a0(contract) to expose softer, more sensitive parts of the tooth root\nperiapical abscess\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a collection of pus at the end of the tooth caused by a bacterial infection\n\nThere are a number of other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn't affected. These include:\n\nperiodontal abscess\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a collection of pus in the gums caused by a bacterial infection\nulcers on your gums\nsore or swollen gums around a tooth that's breaking through \u2013 for example, when your\u00a0wisdom teeth start to come through\u00a0\nsinusitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which sometimes causes pain around the upper jaw\nan injury to the joint that attaches the jaw to the skull (temporomandibular joint)\n\nBabies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. This is known as teething.\nTreating toothache\nThe type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain, so your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out an X-ray\u00a0to try to identify the problem.\nIf your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling.\nIf your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place.\nIf\u00a0the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. This procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection.\nYour tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can't be treated using these methods or\u00a0the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted).\nPreventing toothache\nThe best way to\u00a0avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should:\n\nlimit your intake of sugary foods and drinks\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you should have these\u00a0as an occasional treat and only at mealtimes; read more about cutting down on sugar\nbrush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that contains fluoride\u00a0\u2013 gently brush your gums and tongue as well\nclean between your teeth using dental floss and, if necessary, use a mouthwash\u00a0\ndon't smoke\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it can make some dental problems worse\n\nMake sure you have regular dental check-ups,\u00a0preferably with the same dentist.\u00a0\nThe time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems.\nYour dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health.\nChildren should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early.\nRead more about\u00a0taking care of your teeth and keeping your teeth clean.\n"}, {"Name": "Urinary Incontinence", "Cure": "\nUrinary incontinence is the unintentional passing of urine.
